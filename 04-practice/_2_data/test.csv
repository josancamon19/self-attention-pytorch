"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to italy: Hi Italy! Just opening up communication, and I want to know what some of your initial thoughts on the game are and if/how we can work together",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] italy to germany: Well....that's a great question, and a lot of it comes down to how free I'll be left to play in the West, no?",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to italy: Well, if you want to attack France in the Mediterranean while I attack through Burgundy you can have Marseille and Iberia while I take Brest and Paris, then with France out of the way you could focus on Turkey or Austria. Sound fair?",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] germany to italy: Hello, I'm just asking about your move to Tyrolia. It's making me more than a little concerned",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] italy to germany: Totally understandable - but did you notice the attempt at Trieste?  Tyrolia is the natural support position for that attempt 🙂,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] austria to italy: Hey Italy! What's your plan for the game?,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] italy to austria: Bongiorno!  To crush my enemies, see them driven before me, and hear the lamentations of their women!  I mean, umm, not really sure yet.  Pondering whether or not to make an early play around Munich",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] austria to italy: I'd personally rather you didn't, because a play around Munich is also a play around Trieste and Vienna. I've heard that there's some rancor over in the West and you might be able to profit from a mobbed France if you went that way.",0
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] italy to austria: Good to know, thanks!",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] austria to italy: Well, that went well! Shall we push on with the ways we started?",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] italy to austria: Well, the West and East are both an unholy mess now.  Second fleet incoming, I assume you agree we need to nip that Turkish issue in the bud before it becomes unmanageable?",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] italy to austria: So...was that a no?,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] austria to italy: Indeed.,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] italy to austria: Peccato.  I was really hoping we could bring order (or at least mutual profit) out of the chaos.,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] italy to austria: Sorry we couldn't patch things up.,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to italy: Hey Italy! How’s it going?!,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] italy to russia: Hey hey, what can I say?",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] russia to italy: Hahha what’s good?,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] italy to russia: To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and hear the lamentations of their women",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to italy: Hahahah that’s the spirit sir!,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to italy: Hey Italy - what’s good?,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to italy: Hello Italy, just wanted to thank you for your gift to the culinary world and wish you a good game!",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] italy to england: Just to be clear, that was all in a pasta life.",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to italy: From this one interaction alone I trust you. Please dont betray me and make me eat dish of regretti and meatballs.,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to italy: We both hate how I vs T just slows us both down, right?  Why do we have to be the slow powers in this game?  I say: we don't!  Let's be unconventional.  I have done fun I/T alliances before, but it all depends on making it work.  Let me know if you have any thoughts, or want to just see how the first few seasons roll out, or if there are things you'd like to see from me.",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] italy to turkey: I mean, if I'm free to go another direction, I'll take it in a heartbeat - and I doubt you'll be very upset at my opening moves 🙂",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] italy to turkey: His dots are closer to you. 😃,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to italy: hahahahaha really?,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to italy: If Austria retreats to one of your centers, I guess it means they don't care about trying to repair anything with you, and Just Loves Them Dots, yeah?",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to italy: I may be able to hit Tri in the fall, which would cut it's ability to support Ven, by the way.  If Ion retreats to Adr, that may not help you, but if it retreats to Tun or Nap it would, I guess?  Let's see how the retreats go.",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] italy to turkey: So, now his dots are a LOT closer to you than mine are. 😃

I'm guessing you're ordering into Trieste anyway to protect Serbia while you take Greece with Bulgaria and Aegean. So the question is what is ion doing?",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to italy: It's at your disposal if you want support into Tunis, if that's what you're getting at.",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] italy to turkey: Oh, come now. It's much more amusing to support you into Tunis. That advances the positions rather than retards them",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to italy: Bwa! are you serious?  I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, but I feel like I'm greedy enough stabbing Austria for 3!",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] italy to turkey: Any other arrangement opens me for a stab and sets us up for conflict. Tunis is better for you than Naples, and it's a lot better for me to have you there with a path forward than tied up with me. If you feel bad about it, support me to Trieste",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to italy: Ok, that's totally sensible logic.  I may end up having to pass up on Greece and catch it next year.  I can support you into Trieste, if you'd rather have that than retaking Venice, sure.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to italy: Oh nevermind, you can get both, nice!",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to italy: unless Gre taps Ser, in which case you still recapture Ven, and Austria is stranded in Tri.",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] italy to turkey: Correct. Which is what I'm expecting, but I can hope for Trieste. 😀",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] italy to turkey: You heartless bastard - I can't believe you took him from 5 to 0.,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to italy: It was kinder this way. Put ‘em out of their misery, y’know?",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] italy to turkey: Lol. Probably. That is the great thing about Austria -you either do well or you get to go play another game.,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to italy: Yep. I’m finishing up game 10 of this series now as Austria. Currently on 14 centers, but England has Tunis so no win for me 😦",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-5] [SEASON:Winter] italy to turkey: Ah, well.  
So, what's the plan from here?  How far are you planning on riding that juggernaut?",1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to italy: Well I want to see Russia moves hard on Germany. If they do, well I have a history of jumping on big openings, y’know? :). Otherwise fleets are heading toward Gibraltar!",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-5] [SEASON:Spring] italy to turkey: Sounds fun!,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-5] [SEASON:Spring] italy to turkey: Also, weirdly, my phone doesn't seem to be updating me with latest messages the way it should, so I end up seeing these a lot later than I should",1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to italy: So I tried to move towards a more forward position so I could fight France an d stab Russia, and *not* fight you, but you’re kinda putting yourself directly in my way, y’know?",1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to italy: I could’ve kept you out of Ion permanently but that wasn’t what I thought was very interesting long term. :/,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-5] [SEASON:Fall] italy to turkey: Yeah, I wasn't seeing any response from you, so I moved to defend.  We're having some communication issues based on mis-timing, I think.  Cost us most of a turn, but we have the weekend to work out a way forward, nu?",1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to italy: Sure, understood.  How about this to fix it: Tys S Tun-Wes, Ion-Tun?  You take back a dot, but we push the position forwards toward Iberia?",0
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to italy: are you still not getting any messages from me?,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-5] [SEASON:Fall] italy to turkey: That could definitely work - and it does advance the positions,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-5] [SEASON:Fall] italy to turkey: Otherwise this game is going to be a long, unpleasant slog",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-5] [SEASON:Fall] italy to turkey: I get your messages fine on the computer - it's the phone that seems to not update properly for some reason.  I just hadn't checked the computer yesterday as I should have 🙂,1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to italy: Ok, France has told me outright they're wanting to make sure that ""Italy is divided fairly"", so I doubt they'll expect me pushing past you toward the west.",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-5] [SEASON:Fall] italy to turkey: Looks that way, yes",1
"[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to italy: It's too bad we can't find a way to work together to force me out into MAO, instead of whittling down your defenses season by season.  Once you lose a center, this is going to crumble really quickly, but I'd totally be willing to try something else, even though we both didn't do what we said we do last season.",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] italy to turkey: Aye, it's not a *great* plan to just turtle up and try to outlast the juggernaut.  Would love to see or be shown a better option.",1
"[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to italy: Yeah.  For this season, there’s no point in trying to negotiate something: the risk is too high for you on a fall turn.  But maybe once you’re turtled up and we’re looking at a slightly safer spring move, we can discuss some way to slingshot me past you",0
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Fall] italy to turkey: Absolutely.,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Fall] italy to turkey: And sorry for slow reply - been traveling,1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to italy: No worries - we're on an extended clock right now.,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Fall] italy to turkey: tap-tap,1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to italy: Whassup?,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Fall] italy to turkey: Making sure the mic was working now,1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to italy: Heh indeed it is!,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to italy: Hi Italy, hope you're doing well. I'll be figuring out the situation north of me for the beginning stages so I hope we can keep Pie and Lyo/Wes/Tys  dmz'd if that's ok with you?",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to italy: Hope you are around. Would be good to chat at least briefly 🙂,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] italy to france: Had some technical issues, but the trains are running on time now.",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to italy: Great, what do you think of my proposal?",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] italy to france: Shoot, I was running through the messages so fast I forgot about your proposal by the time I responded.  Sounds like you might have enough on your hands without me annoying you in sensitive spaces, so I'm happy to honor such a DMZ",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to italy: Thanks, let's have a good game!",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] italy to france: Oh, gdi.  Now I have to tell a truth that sounds like the most cliched lie in the game: my order update didn't take, I wasn't intending to go to Piedmont.  Yes, I know it sounds ridiculous, but in this case true.",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] italy to france: Good news is that with your opinion this is more of an opportunity than a disaster (I'd still rather be in Tyrolia where I'm *supposed* to be) - I can bounce you in Mars to help keep you in Burgundy, or if you tell me to eff off, I can move back up to Tyrolia",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: Yes, please, go off on adventures elsewhere ...",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] italy to france: Will do!,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: What plans do you have for Boh? I can maybe support you into Mun if that is likely to succeed,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] italy to france: As awesome as that sounds, I have an Austrian problem to deal with first.  Hopefully diplomatically, we'll see",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to italy: Do you need help? I could build a fleet in Mar, maybe",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] italy to france: You probably have other priorities to attend to, but if can get in position I'm happy to do anything that frustrates Austria",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] france to italy: If you can help a push into Munich, then that's one less flank for you to worry about",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: How are you holding up? It looks bad initially, but Austria will need to disband a lot in Fall because of Turkey's stab. Not sure how you will come out of it though. Do you need help in fending off Turkey?",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] italy to france: Oh, I'm fine, and highly amused
I wouldn't mind being the mover into Munich, though.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: I don't think I'm going for munich this turn but you can give it a shot,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] italy to france: Just as well I didn't see this before the turn processed.,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: I was thinking the same thing...,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: Austria dead in one turn, impressive",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Winter] italy to france: Poor guy - I was really upset we couldn't come to any sort of agreement or arrangement.,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to italy: So, now that Turkey is going to have 4 fleets in the Mediterranean, what's in the future?",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to italy: I doubt they're just going to sit there and let us be.,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] italy to france: War, my friend.  War is in our future.  The faster you can get your fleets into play, the better it will go for us",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: Ok. I'll try to get there.,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: I'm also moving Mar to Pie. Hope that's ok with you.,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] italy to france: It is what it is.  We needs do what we must,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: I'm sure you expect that I'm coming to attack you and, indeed, Turkey is trying to set me up against you. But the way I look at it is that if we were to split your CP, Turkey would still win. I can't let that happen",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: Now you can retreat to Tun and get a CP,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Winter] italy to france: What, pray tell, does CP stand for?",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Winter] france to italy: Oh, sorry it's a supply center. I think mixed lingo there",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] italy to france: I figured you meant support center, I was just curious which language had the abbreviation as CP. 😃",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to italy: Probably some strategy game,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to italy: I'm hoping to get to Mun this round. if you could support Ruh into Mun that would be appreciated. I can support Tyr in turn,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to italy: Alternatively, pressure R somehow to take away support from Mun.",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to italy: We should also come up with a strategy for the mediterranean,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to italy: I figure T is going to Very annoying with that fleet, threatening my supply or supporting a push into Italy. Not quite sure yet how to resolve that.",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] italy to france: Good morning,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] italy to france: Just need to put pressure on R and T, and try to outlast the juggernaut.  At least, that's my view 🙂",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to austria: Hello Austria! I just want to open up communications, since the two of us will be working together for most of the game.",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] austria to germany: Indeed! What's your read on the west thus far?,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to austria: I haven't heard back from anyone else yet, so I'm assuming it's going to develop the normal way (me and France fighting in the west while you and Russia fight in the east). It's critical for us to work together so we aren't steamrolled by either France-England or Russia-Turkey, so do you want to agree to an alliance right off the bat?",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] austria to germany: Absolutely. One of my favorite things about this game is that it can reflect real life history in certain grander strategic considerations, one of which is that, just as would have been the case, neither Germany nor Austria benefits from an antagonistic relationship.",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] germany to austria: So given the first move, I think the two of us are in a relatively strong position. Turkey seems to be focusing more on Russia than you, and England and France are fighting. Are you going to focus more on Russia or Turkey first? I could try and stop Russia from taking Scandinavia unopposed, but I'd need assurance first that you're going to put pressure on them from the south since a move like Warsaw --> Silesia would screw both of us.",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] austria to germany: I'm feeling pretty solid about working with Turkey, so Russia is the target for now.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] germany to austria: So it seems like Italy's turned on us. I can support Vienna --> Tyrolia next move if you want,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] austria to germany: I'm down. Turkey and I will be able to crack Ionian, and Italy will fall hard.",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to germany: Hey Germany! How’s it going? Looking forward to a fun game!,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] germany to russia: Hello! I'm looking forward to a fun game as well. I usually see good things happen when Russia and Germany work together, so I hope we can both help each other in our initial plans. I'm assuming you're gonna try and attack Scandinavia first? Let me know your thoughts, and I look forward to us working well together",0
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Winter] russia to germany: Hi Germany - sorry I’m behind the eightball here - got swamped with work,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Winter] russia to germany: But that seems to have worked out well for you so I’m sure you’re not too upset lol,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] germany to russia: To be honest I was expecting to bounce in Sweden 😅 . From what I've heard England is gonna move Norway --> St. Petersburg this Spring, just thought I'd let you know.",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] russia to germany: Haha word,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to germany: How's it going Germany just wanted to reach out and get your thoughts on the game?,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to england: Hello. I don't have much to go off yet since no orders have been placed, but I'm hoping we can work together during this game. At least in my experience, Germany and Britain tend to work well together since we both have the threat of France, and I would be willing to fend them off while you attack the Russians up north. Let me know your thoughts",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to germany: I like to work with people so I'm open to that plan. I figured I would probably stalemate with Russia for a while while they figured out what was happening down south.,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] england to germany: It feels like years since we've talked. I've noticed russia hasn't really made any moves into the north and wanted to know if we could amicably split up the northern territories?,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] germany to england: I agree, it seems like Russia is undefended in St. Petersburg. If you let me keep Sweden you can have whatever other centres you want in Russia.",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] england to germany: Alright that's seems reasonable.,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to turkey: Hello Turkey! Just opening up communication,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to germany: Comms channel authenticated. Ready to receive transmissions!,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to germany: Wait, so why are you attacking both France and England at the same time?  That seems... dangerous?",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] germany to turkey: I wasn't attacking them, I had non-aggression with them and I had assumed they would've been preoccupied with Russia at least for a few years. I think I can kick out their army in Holland, and from there I guess we'll see what happens.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to germany: ""non-aggression"" doesn't exist in this game, in my experience.  You either have allies who you work with to divide spoils, or you have people fighting you or about to.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to germany: Moving Kie-Hel is a clear act of aggression against England.  Which is fine since they attacked you at the same time, but if they hadn't, they certainly would now!",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] germany to turkey: I agree, I was mostly relying on the fact that England wouldn't attack France, Russia, AND me at the same time.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] germany to turkey: We'll see how things play out,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to germany: England didn't - they *helped* Russia, and given they didn't move to ECH last season, they've clearly been resolving their issues with France.  I would assume they are talking a lot at this point.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] germany to turkey: They're taken ECH now, and even if the support into Sweden proves Russia and England have an alliance there isn't much they can do. I agree that I'm in a bit of a tight spot, but I still have full confidence, especially with you and Austria taking on Russia and Italy so effectively.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to germany: I just gave Russia back their supply center, so they're actually building 2 units now, fyi...",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] germany to turkey: Shit...,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to germany: What you need is an ally you can count on, or you'll be going down quickly unless the board changes significantly.  Maybe start talking to France?",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] germany to turkey: already have been,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to germany: Heh, talking while punching hard into Bur makes it hard to come up with a good alliance plan...",1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:7] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to germany: Hey there.  Who do you hate most?  Russia, France, or England?",1
"[SCORE:2] [SCORE_DELTA:-7] [SEASON:Fall] germany to turkey: Tbh, they all played well. I'm not mad, it was mostly me who fucked up anyways",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to france: Hello France! Just opening up communication. Hope we have a good game together,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to germany: Hi Germany, good to talk to you. Were you hoping for particular command centers in the low lands? I'm considering going for belgium",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to france: Based on what I've heard so far (I have a suspicion England might try for either Holland or Belgium). I'm gonna go for a pretty conservative start (Kiel --> Denmark, Berlin --> Kiel, Munich Hold). Do you want to agree that I take Holland and you take Belgium, then see where we go from there?",0
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to germany: I think that's fine with me.,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to germany: I'm considering playing fairly aggressive against England and cutting them off at the pass in 1901, your support for that would be very helpful.",0
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to france: Sure, a strong England is always a threat to me, so I'd be happy to help annoy them in the North Sea/Scandinavia",0
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to germany: Ok, let's see how things play out and I'll be in touch if I need help",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to germany: It's unfortunate you decided to move this way because now it gets more difficult to stop England,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] germany to france: I agree, there's a good chance England can take Belgium this fall, but I'm also still confident in my position. I'm sorry about your position, that's mostly bad luck.",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to germany: You had assured me Munich would hold but then I find out it moves to Bur instead.,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] germany to france: It wouldn't have changed the final position anyway since you supported with Marseille.,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] france to germany: I would've liked to work together and at least take out england quickly,0
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] france to germany: But I see you have other plans,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] germany to france: So, given the moves of England this Fall, it seems clear that they're attacking both of us. I know I've been... aggressive to you in the past, and I know that chances are you won't believe me or agree to work with me, but if you hear me out we both can gain from this (and utterly destroy England in the process). I'll retreat from Burgundy this Spring, and I'll agree to not invade any more territories of yours until all of England is destroyed. I'm assuming you're going to build a fleet in Brest, and if you do so and move Bre --> Eng in the spring it would cut any support that fleet could provide and I can kick England out of the North Sea. From there I can help support you in to the English Channel or we could work to convoy an army into the British Isles in the next few years. I hope you consider.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] france to germany: I am considering it. England in the channel was not great,0
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to austria: Hey Austria! How’s it going? Looking forward to a fun game!,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] austria to russia: As am I! What direction are you inclined to go? Are you willing to DMZ Galicia?,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] austria to russia: Well, I suppose it's probably a mite hypocritical of me to get angry about the Galicia bounce, but, since you didn't confirm a DMZ, I felt like I had to protect it. Now that we've seen some tangible move data, what are you thinking?",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Winter] russia to austria: I’m down to work together! I got swamped at work yesterday (I work in politics lol) and this slipped my mind. Won’t happen again,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] austria to russia: All good. :),1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] russia to austria: What’s up Austria?,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] austria to russia: Feeling good, I think things are going well.",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to austria: How's it going Austria, just wanted to say hello.",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] austria to england: Doing alright. Haven't heard from many folks yet, so I don't have any concrete plans yet",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to austria: Yeah, I've only heard from you and Russia so far. But to be fair I only just reached out to anyone.",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to austria: A/T move fast and break things?  I’m fleets you’re armies, kill Russia quick, let Italy fart around a few years then carve them up too? Whaddya say?",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] austria to turkey: Solid plan. I'm in.,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to austria: Cool.  Let's see how our neighbors start talking to see how easiest to proceed (i.e if I need to gun right after Russia out of the gate [and hence watching my back against an early agressive Italy], or if I can slip fleets out into the med super early, because we think Russia might not be as much of an early concern, etc...)",0
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] austria to turkey: This is looking quite promising! I look forward to a productive alliance.,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to austria: I have to play some guessing games with Russia - I covered my butt with Arm, but I was hoping I wouldn’t lose Bla.  But you and I are good, and I’m in position to go “mostly fleets” and you my army-heavy ally.  What do you think about Italy?",0
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] austria to turkey: Well, I got him to go to Piedmont, which I didn't expect to work, and having bounced Russia out of Galicia, none of my centers are under threat, so even if Italy gets cute, I'm covering Trieste.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] austria to turkey: Italy decided to break with me, but, you and I will be able to crack Ionian, so, we'll make him regret it, eh?",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to austria: Oh wow, they sure did try to sucker-punch you!  I'm game to go after them, sure, but if Russia starts actually ordering instead of NMR, taking on both of them will be doable, but... slow, right?  Maybe we convince Russia to go deal with their northern front (since there is an E/G clearly)?",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] austria to turkey: True, if Russia pulls BLA then we can definitely leave them alone for a while.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to austria: Yep.  Let them keep War/Mos warm for us for a while, and keep those juicy dots out of English hands. 😉",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to austria: Russia is willing to focus north, holding England back, so we can leave them alone for a while and take out Italy.  Do you want me to support you into Ion, or do you want my unit to be the mover?  We’ll probably bounce in spring so it won’t matter, but fall we’ll succeed so we should decide who is the mover.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] austria to turkey: I'll do the moving.,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to austria: sounds good.  You'll have one support in Spring, and then when that doesn't work, two in the fall.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to austria: Double support of Gre-Ion, right?",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] austria to turkey: That's what I understand the plan to be, yep!",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to austria: Ok, got you into Ion.  Are you attempting to guess a convoy (Nap/Apu?) and want me to support the fleet, or can I do a supported attack on Ion while you move your fleet forward (to Tun/Tys/Nap/Adr)?  We should definitely move forward, but we need to coordinate how to do it.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to austria: BTW: I gave Russia Sev back so they could build against Germany, who was getting way too big. They're building a northern fleet (absolutely no threat to either of us), and probably either Moscow or Warsaw, depending on if going after Scandanavia or towards Berlin.  Just fyi.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to austria: And we work to split Italy between the two of us, right?  Tri/Rom for you, Nap/Tun for me?",0
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] austria to turkey: All sounds good to me. My initial train of thought is, you should do a supported attack on Ionian, while I send my fleet to Apulia. That cuts any chance of that fleet supporting Venice, and guarantees I get in to Venice. How does that sound to you?",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to austria: That sounds good, sure.  If Apu-Nap happens, then you're *in* Apu, which is fine, as it can support follow-on movements to Venice as well.",0
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to austria: (follow-on meaning when your army in Venice continues on to Rome),1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to austria: If I succeed in pushing you forward out if Ion,   and you’re in Apu and Italy is in Nap, we can actually convoy to Nap with support from Apu unless Tun goes to Tys, but in that case Tunis would be open.  Would you want Gre to be the convoy, or could I convoy from Bul?",0
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] austria to turkey: I'd be down for you convoying.,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to austria: excellent, it's a plan!",0
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] austria to turkey: Sigh. We coulda been so good together.,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to austria: Yeah I know.  I got greedy.  :\,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] austria to turkey: I mean, nothing is set in stone yet. You can take it back.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to austria: It’s true - Bud back to Rum and Ser on to Alb could position for more forward convoys without needing the rear fleet...,0
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] austria to turkey: Exactly! My moves will be the same either way, but seeing you do that would be very encouraging.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to austria: Of course if I got stabbed by Russia for Rum at the same time, it would instead stab you, as I’d just bounce out of Rum and get stuck in Bud!  But I’m sure that’s a risk you’d be willing to take.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to austria: I’ll be honest I have to ponder that.  It’s tempting because Italy wouldn’t expect it at all, and would probably move assuming help from me, which would wreck them further",0
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] austria to turkey: Exactly. It'd definitely throw a wrench in what the Italian expects.,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to austria: More than expects: they’re already explicitly asking for Ser-Tri to cut that support,0
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to austria: Hi Austria, good job fending off Italy's attack",0
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to austria: It seems Russia and Turkey have teamed up and, if nothing else, I wouldn't want them to just take over your territory and grow too powerful",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to england: Hey England! How’s it going? Looking forward to a fun game!,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] england to russia: Doing well hope everything is going well on your front.,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to russia: What are your plans in the north? If we butt heads too much germany might swoop in and get free territory.,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] england to russia: Want to figure something out so Germany doesnt take the territory we deserve?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] russia to england: Sure!,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] england to russia: What are you thinking? I could possibly support you into swe if you'll later support me into Den?,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] england to russia: You there?,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] england to russia: Germany is trying to play us both. I'm sure they said something about me attacking you, which I did per their request in exchange for a different territory. They have completely gone against what they said to me, which I kind of expected but figured i would take a chance on. I would like to work with you because Germany is about to run away with this game if we don't take some stuff in the north.",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to england: Yikes,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to england: Yeah I’m down to help!!,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] england to russia: I'm assuming you're going for swe right? I can support you in.,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] england to russia: Assuming germany even moves back,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to england: Yeah let’s do it!,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to england: Thanks!,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to england: Hey what’s up england!,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to russia: Nothing much just trying to get rid of germany after all their meddling. If you can refrain from going after Norway I'd be willing to help you with Den.,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to england: I’m down!,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to russia: Or I could give norway if you support me into Den if that's more to your liking.,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to england: That might be cleaner if that’s cool with you,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to england: Then you can support me in the mainland,1

"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-8] [SEASON:Spring] england to russia: Just getting wrecked, the usual.",1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:8] [SEASON:Spring] russia to england: Hahaha,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-8] [SEASON:Spring] england to russia: You want to hold off for a sec so I can take out france?,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:8] [SEASON:Spring] russia to england: Perhaps.,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-8] [SEASON:Spring] england to russia: Well I can't really stop you otherwise so it's up to you.,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:8] [SEASON:Spring] russia to england: Hahahah fair enough,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:8] [SEASON:Spring] russia to england: Have you heard much from Turkey?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-8] [SEASON:Spring] england to russia: Yeah they want me to hold you off while you they get rid of france. They dont want you getting all my stuff.,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Is the Juggernaut boring? No, I say - it’s simply *retro*!  When executed with panache, they can even be elegant!  What say you?",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Your lively pitch sold me!,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Let’s do it!,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: I suppose the big issue we have to resolve is what we’ll do with the Black Sea.,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Rockin'.  Which variant do you want to try?  Talk to our neighbors first and see how wary and clever they are, before we decide?  We could go all clever [i.e. let one of us take Bla in Spring '01, so we move super fast], since this game is a) short [only 1910!] and b) low stakes [helping train our future AI Overlords!]...",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Could do the slingshot, where you trust me to convoy across and crush your fleet parked in Rum, so you rebuild up north.  Or we could do the ""I trust you"" and let you take Bla while I go to get to Aeg quickly.  Or even the ""we both trust each other"" where we trade Con for Sev while your fleet gets out into the Med to actually be useful!",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: I obviously would feel the most comfortable with the option of you trusting me lol,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: I’m a super loyal ally but I always am weary of a stab,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: yeah, but if we take risks and build some trust right away in 1901, we can just *roll*.  But I'm flexible.",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Yeah that’s totally true,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Perhaps we dive in with the “we both trust each other” option?,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: I'm game.  I usually do that with you in Bla + Ukr + (probably bounce in Gal, but if you can trick A into letting you in, yay!).  Me in Con + Bul + Arm.  Then fall we make sure we get your army into Rum, your fleet takes Con, I take Sev so I don't lose a unit for it (and we can catapult it into action or have you crush it and I rebuild a fleet, depending on how the board looks).",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: That sounds like a great plan to me!!,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: The real fun is how we play it in our negotiations with everyone else.  The fun way is we keep a totally straight face and are all ""How dare he take Bla!  I knew I had to go to Arm just in case!"" ... ""Ok, I'm telling Turkey that I'm taking Rum with Bla, and I think he's falling for it :)"" ... etc.  Nobody falls for it, but it can be fun to try and convince them 🙂",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Lol yeah for sure!!!,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: we need to make sure we keep each other posted on what we say to who,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: So we keep our stories straight and don’t set off any false alarms,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: This is going to be so much fun!,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Agreed on all points 🙂,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: What do you recommend for my first moveset?,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Also diplomatically we should be hoping Italy does not ally with Austria.,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Obviously an A/I would be extra annoying for me, and Italy diving right aggressively into Austria would be icing on the cake, but if we really do move fast and build early trust, there's actually not much they can do unless the west gets involved early.",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Agreed,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Yeah I’m super down!!!,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: First moves: War-Gal, Mos-Ukr, Sev-Bla, StP-Gob.  I do Con-Bul, Smy-Arm, Ank-Con.",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Done!,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: The stories we tell our neighbors depend on a) whether we can convince Italy to attack Austria, and/or b) you can convince Austria you're *not* going to Gal [maybe we convince Austria that Ven-Tri is nearly certain?], so that you end up just walking in.",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Gotcha,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: I've already told Austria I'm wanting to ""go all Fleets!"" (which is not entirely a lie, and ostensibly pro-Austrian), which means when they see my first moves, it won't be a surprise, and may trust me for another season or so as we move the plan forward.  I haven't heard back from Italy yet.  You're the one most likely to be able to convince Italy to attack Austria out of the gate (""hey let's divide the east, work together: we kill Austria first, Turkey next!"" etc).  They're less likely to listen to me.",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Makes sense!,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: I’ll reach out to Italy and keep you posted 😃,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: sounds good.  And if Austria is wary, and wants a bounce in Gal, that's ok too: if you *tell* Italy there'll be a bounce in Gal, that gives them the opening they need to do Ven-Tri or Ven-Trl + Rom-Ven 🙂",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Smooooth,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Obviously I’m going to be blowing all trust with Austria on the first season,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Does that really matter at all?,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: We’re basically betting the juggernaut makes quick work of him,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: It depends: if they say ""I don't trust Italy, I'm ok not going to Gal if you aren't"", then you do blow some trust when you go to Gal.  BUT at the same time you went to Bla!  Austria and I commiserate around how much a dirty rat you are, you tell them that you were sure they were lying, and ""sorry I didn't trust you, but I'll keep attacking Turkey, watch, they think I'll park my fleet in Rum, but I'll attack them instead!"".  They could fall for it, as the moves look pretty weird at first.",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: If on the other hand, Austria asks for a bounce in Gal, you've blown no trust with them at all, and ""attacked"" me.",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: By fall, when I'm in Sev, and you're in Con and Ukr-Rum, it all depends on where War ended up.  Gal in spring?  You probably show your cards in the fall with that unit, yes.  Bounce in spring?  The ruse may not yet be up, unless I need to support you into Rum (in which case it's clear).",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Either way, by the time our Winter '01 builds come out, there'll be no question on anyone's mind, but by then we're moving fast, and hopefully it's too late. Looks good on paper at least, right?  🙂",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Sounds good to me!,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: only thing remaining is: No E/G!  We need F/G or E/F, as early as possible.  As much as I can weather a bit of an A/I if I have your help, there's not much I can do to help you if there's an E/G.  If we can get E and G fighting, the world is our oyster.  I'll open some back channels to see if I can learn anything, but there may not be much to do other than cheerleading any time we hear someone suggest a Sea Lion, or England asking you if you'll just divert Gob-Swe to instead do Bal while they convoy to Den, when Germany ends up in Swe instead of bouncing you out...",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Yeah that’s kinda my theatre to handle,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Thanks for all the guidance!,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: I’ll keep you posted with everything I hear!,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: yeah I'm sure you can handle your northern front just fine.  I'm just thinkin' positive, and the ideal Juggernaut is one with fleets in Ion and Nth.  🙂",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Amen 😃,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Well the *ideal* Juggernaut is when Russian NAO S  Turkish Wes-MAO succeeds - a boy can dream, can't he? 🙂",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Yesssss,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: We’ve got til 1910,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Aye, there's the rub!  We'll give it the ol' college try.",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: (gotta speak in cliches sometimes, to help train this NLP engine we're giving training data too 😉 )",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Austria asked if I am willing to DMZ Gal,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Right, ok, so this is interesting.  You can agree, and then go there anyways, and you just walk in.  Then you're in the weird position where it *looks* like you just successfully sneak-attacked both of us.  You'll get some fun messages from people all over the board! 🙂  But the position will be really good for us.",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Austria DMZ'ing Gal usually means they're covering Tri, so if you can convince Italy to go Ven-Trl, Rom-Ven, Austria is in for a *very* short game, and it'll also be too late for Italy to realize I'm flooding into the med.  So that'd of course be ideal.",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: You get any feel from Italy?  If they were to turn and do pie-trl, ven-tri, that’d be awesome, but I sense more of a “pile on France” vibe in the west...",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: So apparently Austria is covering Tri, so if we’re really doing this, going for Gal should succeed, so that should definitely happen!",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to russia: you didn't move?!?!?  that... kinda blows.  It hurt you more than me, but tbh - I was looking forward to doing our clever plan... :\",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to russia: we can repair this if you disband that southern fleet - as it won't get out into the med quick enough to really be as clever as we'd been planning it to be.  In fact, maybe we can turn this to our advantage?  Austria will never see us working together coming, now, and will get embroiled in an A/I war, and I swing my army down into the balkans while you retake Sev and we're back to the races... it could work.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to russia: Are you still in this game?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Winter] russia to turkey: Hey man I’m so so so so sorry,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Winter] russia to turkey: I work in politics and I’ve been overwhelmed with work,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Winter] russia to turkey: I submitted orders to disband my southern fleet,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to russia: So I have you to blame for Iowa?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Winter] russia to turkey: HAHAH,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Winter] russia to turkey: Yes exactly lol,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to russia: Not a good negotiating tactic, IMO ;p",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Winter] russia to turkey: Hahah so basically,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Winter] russia to turkey: I’m probably not going to be as active as I had hoped, but I will consistently make whatever move sets you recommend and won’t miss another turn",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Winter] russia to turkey: Once again, I am so sorry to have dropped the ball here",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to russia: It’s cool.  We’ll come up with something. Just a game! 🙂,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Winter] russia to turkey: Thanks Turkey 😃,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Winter] russia to turkey: And like I said I totally trust you,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to russia: So here’s a plan, given we have to change things a little, and requires less of your time: Italy and Austria are at war, but E/G are working together, so we pivot this into a loosely coupled RAT alliance: Austria and I head against Italy, and you make sure to hold off the north, and Austria will help if Germany comes on land as well (I don’t think they will: France is hard enough, and Germany taking on France and Russia at the same time has... a lot of poor historical precedent).  I’ll see if I can take Rum and let you grab Sev back so you can build north, but we’ll come up with something!",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Winter] russia to turkey: Sounds good! I’m in!,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to russia: Cool. I’m building F Smy and A Con.  Will get you detailed plans after we see the builds.  Good luck fixing democracy ;p,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Winter] russia to turkey: Lol thanks turkey! doing the Lord’s work haha,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Ok, I'm moving down to Rum, so you should go GoB-StP, Ukr-Mos and either hang tight with War, or really lock down StP by doing War-Lvn.  If you were playing more heavily, I'd suggest the opposite: tell England you'll not even contest StP if they take it with a fleet instead of an army, and instead throw all your armies at Germany, or go with me into eating Austria.  But that requires actually convincing England to go for it, and you don't got time for that shit right now.  So locking down StP should help, if you just want to move the pieces around the board. 🙂",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Done,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Moved to Lvn to be safe,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Thoughts on this turn?,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: GoB-StP, Lvn-StP, Mos-Sev, hopefully build F StP(nc)! 🙂",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: I don’t need a build this year, you do",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: In some sense it’s a better RT than we’d planned, if it works!",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: England wants to help me take Sweden - should I beleive him?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Thanks for Sev my friend!,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: I think yes he could lie, but I told him he should work with you there.  I suggest offering the support, but telling him you’ll naturally have to cover StP in case he’s lying.  Then the safe bet is Lvn covers StP (no northern fleet build 😦 ), and build A War.  The risky bet is bluff E out of StP, leaving it open for a build while you support the attack on Swe.",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Ill play it safe and protect stp,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Take what you can get,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: If I can get two builds this year I’ll definitely improve my odds of surviving lol,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: Well if you think this build is likely, you could save Sev for next year: self bounce Lvn and Mos in StP, and take Swe with GoB, and build a northern fleet - maybe South Coast to not piss off England.  Then next year you take back Sev, and build *another* northern fleet!  That’d be pretty baller",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Why do I need a northern fleet?,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: Because you’re the only one in the east who can build them, and StP is extremely easy for the west to take, and then hold forever",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: Northern fleets are the only way you and I are over the traditional stalemate line,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: So you need them sooner rather than later,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: And thus they make you indispensable to any eastern alliance,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Makes sense!,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: How about I just trust england and hold in Lyn,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Then I get two builds which will help me expand and a northern fleet,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: I trust england to want to hurt Germany,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: That works too!,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Sweet!,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: Rockin, E/G war is what we really need.",1

"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to russia: nice work, two builds, you're back in business!",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to russia: I'm pondering fillet'ing Austria.  Are you busy fighting Germany, or are you interested in taking a little part in that?  With this A/I war, I've got the position to mostly do it myself, but if you had A War and wanted to take part in maybe getting Vienna for yourself, you could use that to fuel your further expansions while I gobble most of the rest of Austria and push through the med...",1

"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to russia: Coolio.  Build that northern fleet to keep some northern play, and that unit in War (and if Austria asks, just say it's because you *just* took a center from Germany, and are prepping for what that will clearly lead to).  And then Gal is the direction it should clearly go, with the only thing left is timing: we both go simultaneously and it's curtains for the hapless archduke!  Board situation may even call for a spring stab for position with fall being utterly ruthless:",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to russia: I walk into Bud, Ser, Bul, you into Gal, fall move I support you into Vie and Italy back toward Tri while attacking Gre, and... *pop* from 5 down to 1 or 2.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to russia: then I build a turkish armada, and even having given Italy a build, it doesn't help them, and you're fueled and ready to pick which of E/G to poke at (first) 🙂",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to russia: but happy to hear other suggestions (as long as they all involve me getting Yuge ;P ),1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to russia: Your builds are in, right?",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Yessir,1

[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: How does that sound?,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: That sounds great, except for one possible question: do you want to coordinate with Germany against England?  StP S Swe-Nwy ?",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: I don’t have much of a relationship with either,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: But engl helped me with Sweden,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: So the thing I notice on this board is that you and I are the only ones thinking about “alliances”.  Everyone else is talking about extremely short term arrangements. “Gunboat with a little bit of talking”, basically.  There is no FG alliance, it’s just that they’re both fighting England... for now.  It’s odd (to me).  I’m all for dynamic play, but you never get anywhere in this game if you only go it alone.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Your moves sound fine, but just don’t treat England as an ally - they merely helped you so their attack on Holland would lead to an enemy who wasn’t simultaneously building another unit.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Yeah for sure,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Just all things being equal I rather hit the guy who I haven’t worked with before hahaha,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Then maybe F StP(sc) might have been more useful.  Next build! 😉,1

[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Nice. Question for you:,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Why didn’t Germany take Hol? How did england hold it with no support? Am I missing something?,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: Bel S Hol,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Got it! Thanks!,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Long term how should be dispose of the remaining powers? I think Germany is the clear next target for me and Italy for you?,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Then I’ll be strong enough to push England off the mainland and hit them by sea from the north and France won’t be much of a problem? The only thing we have to fear is any strong alliances between the remaining players.,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: Position is key: you need to get well pushed over the stalemate line, and I'll be focussing on getting a bit past Italy to France, in fact (hence my new fleets)",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Makes sense. Munich is my main goal for next year, Kie as well ideally.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: Yep.  I may be able to help with Munich.  And we may need to balance centers - me owning Munich longer term helps me agaianst France,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: For sure. I have no problem with that as long as I keep growing every year.,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: In the short term it’s a good hold for me as I cripple Germany.,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: totally agreed.,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: You may want to just leave Vie behind and focus on Germany, it's not like Italy could hold it even if they took it.  Vie-Trl, Gal-Boh, War-Sil is a continuing brutal charge toward Munich.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Yeah that’s my thought too. At this point it isn’t worth it in my mind to work something out with Italy,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: Don't worry about them, they'll be busy dealing with me 🙂",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Amen!!,1
"[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Here’s my current orders:

[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Let me know what you think!!,1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: I’m a bit concerned about leaving Vie open.,1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: How about this: I will cover Vie for you: Bud-Vie, Ser-Bud, Bul-Ser.  If Italy goes to Vie, we’ll bounce and you’re safe.  If I just walk into your center, I have three units on Tri for fall to guarantee it, and Vie will be the mover so you will keep your center. In short: I’ve got your back :). Just remember to pay me back later when I need a similar favor 😉",1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: For sure! I’m pretty comfortable with this alliance. The game automatically ends in 1910 so there isn’t really enough time for an outright victory. But working together we should have enough time to whipe everyone else off the board. I’m down to set it to a two way draw once we’ve knocked out everyone else!,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Agreed on all accounts.  I don't even think we can truly eliminate *everyone* else.  But we can try 🙂,1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: If we have to go three way so be it,1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: As we get further along, we can see if other powers need eliminating, or if they can make themselves useful while being small enough / positioned properly to not be a threat in any way.  I’m not focused very much on the draw size - I care more about “proximity to a win” in a more abstract sense than number of remaining players.",1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Makes sense to me,1

[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Those are the moves I have set right now. I’m obviously a bit concerned about ENgland’s fleet to the north. I really need to make sure I get to build a northern fleet this winter,1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: We have to take Tri now, actually",1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: I’m worried ENgland and France worked something out,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: Vie s Bud-Tri plz,1

[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: EF are allies now yes,1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: Expect English trouble coming at you like, now",1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: That makes it all the more imperative to knock out Italy and Germany quickly,1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: I’m worried I won’t be able to take Munich,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: Yep,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: You may not until we have Trl,1

[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: What moves do you recommend?,1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: I desperately need a build this turn to built a northern fleet. Perhaps even abandoning Nwy is a fall back,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: Lemme look more closely at the board and get back to you after lunch!,1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Deal!,0
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: I think you need to stop the Nwg-Bar move, by doing Nwy-Bar.  At the same time, we need to just give you Tri so you can build another northern fleet.  We can give it back to me next year and if necessary you just disband a rearguard army to make up for it if you’re not picking up another build somewhere else.",1

"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: Also, since you probably won’t get Mun, move War-Pru to make sure it gets to the front lines.  It’s not quite as good as Sil if you got Mun now, but you can still shuffle",1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: What about war - Gal?,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: It’s slow to get to the lines,1

"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: Ok looking at the next few seasons, War-Gal is too slow.  War-Pru, and I’m giving you Tri now, for your build, but basically right after, you should be doing Boh S Tri-Trl, and you’re right smack on where you need to be with all of Trl, Boh, Sil, Pru, and Ber.  As you do Tri-Trl, I’m following into Tri to push on Venice and Piedmont.  Plus  like I said, Pru also gives you the option of convoy to Swe so your fleets are more free to move around while an army garissons your Scandinavian holdings (and even do Bal+Swe attacking Den)",1

[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Great catch,1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: It seems to have a 15 minute grace so you literally were not a moment too soo.,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: No shit! It worked! And everything went smoothly!,1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: What a lucky save,1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: And two builds will make it easy to pass tri back to you as I love my army north. I should take at least Den next turn so I won’t have to disband,1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: *move,1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: So I suggest build just the fleet, and hold the other for next year in case you need another fleet. We have a solid army marching forward already.",1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Meh I’ll have to look at the board in the morning but my inclination is to take the extra army and if I have to disband it I have to disband it,1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: But if you *dont* need to disband it, you won’t be able to build another fleet if you stay even after losing Tri but winning Den.  But yeah let’s chat about it after retreats.",1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Yeah you’re right just looked at the map holding the build this turn so I can lock up fleet #5 next year seems to be the move,1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: I feel great about where we’re at. We’re pushing past the stalemate line,1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: Way past.  I’m in Wes, also, which is good as it keeps France from sending Fleets to help England",1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: So suggestions, after builds are in: Swe S Bal-Den, Bal-Den, Nwy-Nth (guarantees Den succeeds), StP-Bar (making room for that next build).  I think doing a similar risk with Munich might be warranted: Mun-Kie, Ber supports that, Boh S Tri-Trl, Pru-Sil.  Then you likely pick up Kie but lose Munich, but can easily retake Mun in the fall.",1
"[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to russia: oh wow, nevermind, I didn't realize England already vacated Nth.  Must revise thoughts...",1
[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Winter] russia to turkey: Let me know who you come up with! I submitted a build for a northern fleet and that’s it,1
"[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: So in the north, F Nwy S StP-Bar is a lock, and protects Nwy and keeps England locked out of Bar, completely.  With respect to Swe/Den, taking Den with Swe leaves Bal in place, which is great for taking on / protecting Kie/Ber.  However, that also brings up another great use of F Bal: convoys.",1
"[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: F Bal C Pru-Den, F Swe supports it, and either A Mun-Kie (with support from Ber) or A Ber-Kie (with Boh supporting Mun) ensures that Denmark is captured.  The only counter to that is something I doubt they're clever enough for: Bur + Ruh S Kie-Mun, Hol S Den-Kie - abandon Den in exchange for taking Mun and saving the Danish army by putting it in Kiel.",1
"[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: If you go with Mun-Kie, then use Boh to support Tri-Trl.  I'll cover Vie again with Bud.",1
"[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Our situation with your Vie/Tri centers is tricky: once you recapture Trl, and I'm in Tri, we can press on them, but as long as we need to worry about protecting Vie/Tri from falling into their hands *and* from falling into *my* hands (unintentionally - to keep them out), it'll slow us down, and possibly rob you of the ability to get that last needed northern fleet.",1
"[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: For now, I'm doing the Bul-Ser-Bud-Vie choo-choo train, as well as taking Adr and moving Gre-Alb.  If you decide to use Boh S Mun, you probably still want Tri-Trl, but that unit may get wrecked by Ven S Trl-Tri.  I'll take back Tri in the fall, and your army there would have been evaporated in that case, but net effect is it won't change your ""available builds"" count, and if you stay even elsewhere, you'll still have another F StP to pull out.",1
"[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: My southern army is a short term problem that will resolve itself in the next year or so as you (and France potentially?) crush Italy. If it must be disbanded and reincarnated as a final northern fleet, so be it.",1
[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Here is what I have set at the moment;,1

[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Once Italy is broken and I’m hitting England from the north if for whatever reason I lose Vie it will be a very easy target for reconquest by a Warsaw built army,1
[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Let me know what you think of the orders I have submitted and then it you don’t mind sending me yours I would appreciate it (no need tho),1
"[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Your orders look fine.  Since Tri-Trl is moving unsupported and Italy can counterattack, I definitely need to be ready to crush them in Tri in the fall.  We really didn’t help outlet position with this mildly entangled mess in Austria.  As for you keeping Vienna long term: it is all about moving our alliance forward.  Currently you need the builds, so I got you into Vie and then Tri.  You’re fighting three enemies.  But as you focus on just two, and I come into contact with France, I’ll need the builds just as much, so we’ll just keep track of where we need those builds to come from as we press forward!",1
"[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: As for moves, it may make sense for me to attack Tri with support now, and if you dislodge, retreat to Vie, which both protects Vie, and allows you to use that to attack Trl.",1
"[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: So I propose A Bud s Ser-Tri, Ser-Tri, Gre-Alb, Bul-Gre",1
[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Hey Turkey you are totally right and I am absolutely happy to shead those builds to you to help you move the ball forward in the south,1
[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Very good point.,1
[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: If I pick up two this turn then I won’t need either center! I just want that northern fleet haha,1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Agreed: keeping England on the defensive and keeping all of their armies locked up is key.  The hardest part will be the island and the French home centers.  But once England starts losing centers they’ll crumble.,1
[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: What if I just move A Tri - Vie?,1
[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Then you can support me into Thr in the fall?,1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Yep that works too,1
[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Makes more sense to me!,1
[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Done.,1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: The only reason to hit Trl now is to cut any support Trl might give to an attack on Mun.,1
[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Hmmm,1
[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Good point,1
[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: In that case hitting Tyr is the superior move. I can still retreat to vie potentially,1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Yep that was what I was thinking.,1
[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Lit,1
[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: I appreciate running my moves by you. Working with you this game has taught me a lot and made me a stronger player!,1
"[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: But losing Munich in the spring is not a catastrophe- retreat to Sil, and you already have huge pressure on Kie to ensure you’d get Mun back quickly. It’s a small gamble either way.",1
[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: I agree but I rather not loose ground there,1
"[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Thanks.  It’s been super fun so far. 🙂  I haven’t played online in years, but used to play f2f with the world’s greatest players (no exaggeration).",1
[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Woah!! That’s amazing.,1

"[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Wow, that went really well, again. 🙂",1
"[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: So I'm retreating to the Gulf of Lyon, because hey, I can. 🙂  That single lone fleet behind enemy lines will wreck *havoc* on France's ability to concentrate: it will take both of their fleets, *and* one of their armies, to cover all their bases in Spa and Mar (imagine what you'll be able to do once you can slip a single fleet into NAO? :] ).",1
"[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: You should be able to hold Munich with the same kind of moves as this past season (Ber-Kie, Boh S Mun, except this time, Bal and Den can also support the attack on Kie, while Swe S Den and Bar S Nwy).",1
"[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Meanwhile, Trl can help you hang onto Tri while I move out into Ven: Trl S Tri-Ven, Adr S Tri-Ven, and I think I'll get in.  Which would put you up one for Den, and you already had one in the bag, so you could build A War and F StP.",1
"[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: My moves in Italy are going to be some fun guessing games.  I can convoy from Greece to Apu or guess that Italy will think I'd do that, and try instead to be tricky and dodge past them into Naples.  But are they the sort of person willing to risk a home center on a fall move?  I'm guessing not.",1
[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Nice! I could potentially be up 3 if I take Kie as well.,1

"[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: If I can lock up both den and Kie this year, england will have to disband a unit. Potentially with you fleet you can knock France down a peg and we should be dropping Italy to 3 with Ven",1
[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: I’m still bullish on us having a real shot to sweep the board by 1910. We’re inching closer to sending them past a total break down point.,1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: In crazy work offsite meetings today (on a boat!) so won’t be able to talk much until tonight.  But your moves look great at a glance.

"[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: well, you're building F StP(nc), so you can start sliding Nwy-Ska, Bar S StP-Nwy, and maybe trying to slide Swe-Den somehow.  Then you'll have enough force to make England choose between Nwg and Nth",1

[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: I think it’s an easy yes from me lol. Put England to bed then we can overrun France in no time. And at this point if I’d rather it end in a 3 way victory than a 5 way,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Working with France right now will take some pressure of me in the short term and help me put England to bed for good,1
"[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: So IMO, if we want things to move faster, yes, we offer France whatever they want in exchange for them turning on England, and at the same time, be ready to offer England to help them punish the one who stabbed them (France).  So offer Holland to France, totally!",1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Lit!,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: He might move his fleet out of the med,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Also any intel on what England’s fleets are doing could save me some time in breaking out in the North Sea,1
"[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: But it will be a marriage convenience: as soon as the two of them are fighting each other, we have no need to hold back: we take them both on at the same time.",1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Agreed,1
"[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: I mean you can still hit France, I can be his “buddy”",1
"[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Yeah, it'll be easier for you to take out England if you're playing nice with France for the time being.",0
"[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: You can even tell them ""darn, Turkey keeps going after you - maybe we should work together against them once we crush England a little?"", so they trust you even more.",1
"[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: As for what England is doing with the fleets - they're not telling me, and I know what *I* would do, but I don't know what they would do.",1
"[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: So I'm letting France take Tunis, by the way.  So if you decide to help them with Hol, they'll get two builds this year.  Just FYI.",1
"[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: One nasty approach is too give France support to take Holland in the spring, but then follow in and take it from them in the fall, and they don't get a build at all, and yet have already pissed off England, and they can't work together anyways :]",1

"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Alright, so, I'm kind of tangled with Germany. England is my temporary friend. I think they also want to hit Germany.",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: I think England may have seen Stp as a move of opportunity, I'm not sure, since if they had moved to Swe it would've been a lot better, honestly",0
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] russia to france: I can work with you guys,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-5] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I think it's clear that it's just a matter of time before you overrun England's position. Would you mind divvying up the remains?,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Hey France! Appreciate you not hitting me last year.  I could be down for something like that,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: What’s your relationship like with England? Until last turn I was under the impression you guys were allies,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-5] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: We were/are, yeah. But Englands position is not tenable. E made some mistakes when we were mopping up G and it just took too long.",0
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Makes sense. Aside from me and turkey you’re clearly the strongest and it works for me to work with you so I can just focus on England,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: What are you thinking in terms of this season?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-5] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I wish my fleets were available,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Ugh same,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-5] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I'm thinking of siding with E for another season and then going for a stab in Holland in Fall,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Yeah that makes sense,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: I’d have to look at it again in the morning but I might be down to help you out,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Clearly turkey and I are allies so I’m not tryna step on any toes,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-5] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Fair enough,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: I’d be very interested in what moves england is planning on making,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-5] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I'll see if I can put a fleet in Mao to go for Lvp while you take the east side,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Yeah that would be legit.,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: I’m down to support you into Holland,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Fighting you over it would be a pain for both of us,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Could you get me intel on England’s next moves?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-5] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I'm reaching out but we'll see if they're still tuned in to the game,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Gotcha wouldn’t be shocked if they check out,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: This study is so much fun,1
"[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Like getting paid to play this game, what can beat that?",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-5] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: That is awesome, yeah. Though I wish I could play diplomacy in a short burst 😄",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-5] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Turkey seems to be taking things very seriously,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Yeah I feel like he’s hardcore,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Maybe we can look at him after we build up strength by taking out england,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-5] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I've played Turkey a couple of times but never got Russia to ally with me. It's quite strong,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-5] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: At the same time, I've never seen such an eagerness to cooperate either",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-5] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I'm guessing Turkey imposed DMZs on Vie/Bud etc?,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: It’s not overly formal,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Mostly we had a common interest in taking out Austria,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: And I skipped a turn early on and needed an ally to survive,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-5] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Ah yes I remember that,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-5] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: The Sev disband probably helped with the mutual trust 🙂,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Absolutely,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: So do you want support into hol this turn or wait til fall?,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: What’s good France,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: If I remember correctly we were just starting to work together against england lol,1
"[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Winter] france to russia: Yeah, I'll move out to Lvp now and see if we can push through the fleets",1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Winter] russia to france: Awesome! If you build a fleet you can help me take the North Sea. Once we break England’s baby we’re chilling,1
"[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Cool, I'm moving into Eng. Any particular plans from there?",1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: We can talk about how to divid it up. We definitely should make sure we both get builds. we’re good to pause aggression on our front on the continent?,1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Sounds good,1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Do you have a will to team up on Turkey at this point? I can't stop T by myself,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Maybe! I don’t know if we could take him at this point,1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Realignments are always possible 🙂,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Winter] russia to france: Yeah I agree,1
"[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Winter] russia to france: Clearly turkey stabbed me. If it’s not too late, I want to take you up on your offer to work together.",1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Let me know what you’re thinking. I’m super on board to work together.,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Hello?,1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Hey, sorry was busy playing Civ with some friends 🙂",1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Lol nice!,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: How are you holding up with the craziness?,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Yeah it's a time sink,1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I'm fine, just gotta keep social contacts going even though they're virtual",1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Absolutely!,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: But the board state is giving me a headache,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Join the club,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Has turkey reached out to you at all?,1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I think, given our position we can't survive if we don't work together",1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: 100%,1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Like, I don't think you can protecct War,Mos & Sev by fall",1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: For me, I don't know about Spain & Por.",1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Nah. I think the only one of my original supply centers I can save is StP,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: I think we have to put England to bed quickly so we can turn all our sights on Turkey.,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Luckily it's somewhat independent,1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Though it seems likely turkey would reach out to E, perhaps",1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Yeah of course.,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: I haven’t spoke much with him since the early game.,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: At the end of the day we have to just survive three years.,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Yeah he just wants to take you on,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: I don’t think he’ll be useful against England and I rather put one front to bed so we can focus on the real enemy,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: *against Turkey,1
"[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: With a tightly coordainated strategy I think we can at least force a 3 way draw, perhaps even regain some ground.",1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: It looks like you can get Lvp and Edi this turn.,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Yup.,1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I could chase after Mao or go for Lon, what do you think?",1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: I’m more worried about the fleet than the army,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: I think one rouge English fleet could be a hastle whereas the army is trapped on the mainland and will probably get disbanded anyway,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: I also think we need to go on the offensive in the balkans before he gets more builds,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: I can support Pie to Tyr which should break his line,1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Yeah, I'll be withdrawing from Ruh to cover my CP from Mao then and potentially get through to italy",1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: I’m hoping he stretches himself a little too thin taking my home centers and opens up Central Europe for us to dive in,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Perfect. We can’t let him get out of the Mediterranean,1
"[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: As we move forward, once I start taking centers in the balkans I would be happy to return hol and other centers to keep you strong",1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Actually could you support mun to tyr?,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: That would be a faster way for me to deploy my armies away from you and get them at the front lines ASAP,1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I'd be happy to, but I expect Pie to get attacked",1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: So don't count on it,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: From venice with support from Tyr.,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: And Tus,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Gotcha that doesn’t shock me.,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: I’m gonna support with Boh as well,1

[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: NAO can go to Lvp directly,1
"[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: If we put england to be and I can get my fleets into the med he’s in trouble. That being said, it’s much easier for me to just shed supply centers to you and disband my fleets once’s england is toast",1

[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: I’ll do it in the fall,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: I want to get my fleets out,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Sure,1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: So if you don't attack Tyr, there's a real chance my Pie army cannot retreat",1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Oh no,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: What do you think is best?,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Not the end of the world of course.,1
"[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: What if you play defensively, move Mar to Spain supported by Wes and move pie to Mar supported by bur?",1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I can support Pie - Mar with Bur and then support Mar - Spa with Wes to make room,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Better to lose the buffer territory than to lose the army.,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Hahaha okay so we’re on the same page lol,1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: With a bit of luck, england goes to Por, and I can destroy their fleet by fall",1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Epic,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Can you move Ruhr to Belgium or elsewhere to make room for me to deploy holland closer to the front?,1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Alright, seems good.",1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Will do.,1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Btw, if you want to get Nwy to Stp/sc in spring then you could make it just barely in time.",1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: I’m looking into move Den thru Scandinavia,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Might be faster,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: In which case you could leave Ruhr where it is,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Nah I think I’m just gonna park the fleet in StpN and then focus on break past the stalemate line in Central Europe while he over extends himself taking my centers,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: So if you can move Ruhr that would help,1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Alright, moving Ruh",1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Maybe you can just take Mun,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: That gets that army to the front instantly and if someone gets a build it should be you,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Since you can drop fleets right into the med,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Your naval front is gonna be where this is won or lost,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: If he can take full control of the med we’re toast,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: I rather have you take mun than keep that army trapped behind our lines all year,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I'm fine with that too but what will you do with Mun?,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Move it east?,1
[SCORE:11] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: I think the pivotal factor this year is seeing if he spreads himself thin enough for us to punch through his line in Central Europe. If we can start eating tho supply centers and put him on the defense we will come out ahead.,1

[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to turkey: I did the same,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to england: Thankfully they explicitly mention it’s ok to have the infamous “It was true when I said it!” excuse,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to turkey: maybe they've run into this issue previously,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to england: Among diplomacy players? Never.,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to turkey: Hey are you doing anything with russia? I've tried reaching out to them and they haven't responded back to me so I'm assuming they're plotting something.,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to england: Well they definitely are plotting lots of things.  I covered myself with Arm, but them taking Bla will require some guesswork on my part.  Hopefully I can convince them to just take Rum with the fleet...",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to turkey: Alright, them not responding to me and pushing north makes me think they don't really have any desire to work with me. Just figured I'd talk to you to see if we could coordinate so russia isn't able to easily push both fronts.",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to england: How did they push north?  3 units went south, the only northern move they did is StP-GoB.",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to england: From what I can tell, Russia was worried that Austria and I were ganging up on them (at least that’s what Austria tells me, and the excuse Russia gave for both War-Gal and Sev-Bla).  So I’m game to try and out guess them with you, but I think Russia is looking for an ally anywhere.  If you offered an alliance with them (real or fake) they would probably take it.  For example if you offered to convoy to Den while they drop into Bal, they’d probably do that, setting off an R/G war (not sure if you want that, but you could).",0
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to england: Seems like you and Germany are already teaming up on France, so you can probably keep Russia contained in the north without too much effort, right?",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] england to turkey: I'm not teaming on France. Also I assumed russia was going to go for Norway so I'm a bit confused with their plan as they haven't talked to me other than saying hello.,1

"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to england: StP doesn’t touch Sweden: the northern Russian fleet can never bother England in the first few years of the game: its moves are almost always StP(sc) - GoB, then GoB-Swe.  The only time England ever has to worry about Russia in 1901 is if they send A Mos-StP, because *that* unit *can* threaten Nwy.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to england: Maybe we’re misunderstanding each other?,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] england to turkey: Yeah I think we are, I was talking about over multiple turns. It's just weird how russia isn't making any moves for depots in the north and seems to be letting germany just have at it.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to england: Russia didn't move because they lost track of time, it wasn't intentional, I'm sure.  I haven't heard from them since the Spring moves.",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] england to turkey: Okay, I wasn't sure if had been some mind gaming or what happened.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to england: No, they totally screwed their position by not moving - look in the south!",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] england to turkey: Yeah, that's why I wasnt sure if they were just playing really passive to try some trick. But it's pretty obvious now looking at it.",1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to england: So it looks like while you worked something out with Russia, to carve Germany up, you’re now reorienting against them.  You want to coordinate anything with me, or am I “the enemy”? 🙂",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Fall] england to turkey: I'm completely fine coordinating, what are you thinking?",1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to england: Well both of us have only two main competitors left: France and Russia. If we each take on one while the other goes after the other, we’ll kinda split the board up but it’ll be slow.  If we pick the same enemy, it’ll go faster, but we’ll have to leave ourselves a little undefended in the opposite side.  I go after Russia, most likely France grows big in the Med.  You go after France, Russia is breathing down your neck.  That’s my main concern: how do I go after Russia if I know France will quickly be taking control of Italy?  Can we somehow keep France tied down so we’re free to mostly focus on Russia?",0
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:9] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to england: Wow, did France actually stab you? In this position?!?  Doesn’t he know you can throw your remaining strength into making sure he dies, to spite the stab?  Maybe she thinks there is not enough time in the game for me and Russia to eliminate him?",1

"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:9] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to england: I can ask Russia if they will lay off off you for a couple of seasons so you can throw your units against France.  I'm sure he'll attack you eventually, but I could probably get you a two season head start?",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-9] [SEASON:Spring] england to turkey: Yeah, I get the feeling I'm not going to survive much longer anyway. But it would be nice to get back at france for their betrayal.",1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:9] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to england: I’m attacking France with all my strength. If you send Nth-Ech you’ll block Bre-Ech, and if you also do Nwg-Nao and Edi-Nwg you can maybe take France down with you!",1
"[SCORE:13] [SCORE_DELTA:10] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to england: please please please build an army at home to defend for a few more seasons?  I'm attacking France and will help you exact your revenge on them, just don't give all your centers to Russia? 🙂",1
"[SCORE:13] [SCORE_DELTA:10] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to england: If I can get into Spain, I will support you to hold in Portugal until the end of 1910 so that if we do it right, France gets eliminated for stabbing you, and you survive with that center plus whatever you can hold in Britain (which I can't help either way with)",1

"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: Howdy France, just wanted to reach out and see what your thoughts on the game were.",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: Hey England, I was wondering how you would want to align yourself, assuming it's not against me, how far would you go to attack G or will you go with a northern opening against R?",1

"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Yeah, I plan on taking Norway and wanted my fleet already in the water to move wherever needed. I figured at some point we would negotiate who could go for bel or hol while you get the rest of the iberian peninsula.",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Yeah, I was hoping to get a foothold in Bel. From there I could support e.g. your new build into Hol.",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: There seems to be some sort of central non aggression pact going based on their movements.,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Since G decided to stab me, I'm inclined to get back at them",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: I think we need to worry about germany getting alot of territory early.,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Yeah, Russia is going south, same for Austria. G has a free playing field. I don't think we can stop 2 builds for G either",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: I'll probably reach out to russia and see if we can stop them from getting too crazy in the north.,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: afk for a bit,1

[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: So that it looks like we're going for each other?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Let's see. We should plan out 1902 because after that G basically should have completed their Atlantikwall and we can't get you in to help me any more,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: I need to see what I does. I'm hoping I changes their mind about attacking Mar because that's not so easy.,1

"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] england to france: No, they still haven't responded to me. I'm not sure why they moved the way they did unless they're not trying to piss of Germany.",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] england to france: How do you feel about next year moving your fleet into pic and I move mine into the eng and one of us can support the other into Bel?,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] england to france: I could also go for Den and move my fleet into Nth to support you as well.,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: I think R just didn't submit orders,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: I'm cool trying to support you into Bel. I'm thinking about how to move so that G gets removed from Bur while also being able to support an attack on Bel,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: I think maybe moving my fleet to Mao so that I can take Portugal in fall and you can take Eng to support an attack on Bel could be an option?,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: I'm fine with that plan. I finally got russia to respond so hopefully we'll be able to work together to stop Germany from the top and I can help you push them back as well.,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: Maybe we can convince Austria to push from the other side to put pressure on all sides?,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: Maybe but I'd think it unlikely,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: Yeah, might be to early for them to start backstabbring",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: Since Italy tried for Tri, that's gonna be their focus. And R is no longer AFK so hopefully that will help",1

"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: Instead of focusing on Bel, we could put pressure on Hol & Den if you move to Hel? What do you think?",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: I was trying to convoy my army into den because I'm assuming germany is going to try to move their fleet there. But I suppose we'll have two more turns to get them out if I just go hel.,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: Russia is back, but they're still really bad about responding.",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: What would you achieve by convoying to Den?,1

[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: Just the threat of that may force R to defend and will allow A Nwy-Swe,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: Then in Fall you have another support for attack on Den,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: Might have to since they are responding at all.,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: There's a good chance G is sweettalking them and offering Swe and an alliance,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: I suppose that's always a possibility,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: Germany responded back to a message I sent a while ago telling me I can have at Russia if I let them keep swe. So I'm going to guess they're probably saying something similar to russia.,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: Are you okay with me moving my fleet into Eng?,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: Russia is basically a vassal state of Germany as far as I can tell. Maybe you can try to talk some sense into them? I'm going to plan on moving my fleet into Eng this round, and see how I can support you from there.",1

Now, without Eng to support, it will be hard to take Bel if G makes the right moves.",1

"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: If you didn't have the emoji show up on your messages or didn't click either 👍 or 👎 , just assume it didn't send",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: The more I look at the board the more likely it seems T & R are biding their time for R to rebuild and then ally up,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: Not that it matters for us currently, we would still have to crush G asap to get the cp we need to defend against that",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: So what's next? Will you support me into Bel?,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] england to france: Yeah I think they're probably going to working together as well. Yeah I'll support you in.,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: After I push G out of Bur, I can push for Mun while you go for Kie or Den",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] england to france: Sounds like a solid plan to me,0
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] england to france: Sounds like a solid plan to me,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: Alright, so I'll try to get Bel this turn, can I get your support for that?",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Based on Russia's fleet I think I'm going to be having some trouble in the north soon.,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Yeah I saw that,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Thanks for the assist by the way,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Turkey and Russia almost definitely teamed up,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Definitely working together. What's your plan this season? Hold or push further? I'm possibly getting backstabbred by russia and making a push for Den.,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: I think Den is good. G will probably disband fleets. You can also just go Nwy-Stp on retreat if you're afraid of the stab there...
I'll move the line up to munich for a push next year. You can take Kie with my support or Den with your fleet, and I take Mun after.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: There's a small chance you can just do A Hol-Kie, since G needs to cover Ber from R",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Actually, if you could do that, that would guarantee I can move into the Ruhrgebiet",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: I can give it a shot,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Are you moving Bel? If not could you support, hol in case Germany tries a push there?.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: I was thinking of using bel to support a move into Ruh,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Can you support A Bur-Ruh? Then I can support a hold in Hol.,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Yes, I just updated to support bur into ruh",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Ok. Will update.,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] england to france: I negotiated with russia not realizing they were going to easily walk into Austria and Germany. I may have thrown this game, my bad.",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: Yeah, R & T position is very strong now.",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: Could you move Eng out to NTH? Or elsewhere? I'm moving Bre to Mao and Mao to Wes,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: Yeah, I'm moving the up to hopefully contest russia.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Can you support me moving Nth into Hol? And support Kie if possible? Once I get Hol I think I should be pretty good to hold off Russia from the north.,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: I can support Hol but I'm using Ruh to push into Mun, or at least prevent R from doing so.",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: support a push into Hol,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Okay. Also turkey reached out to me about attacking russia together, but they wanted to know how I would stop you from taking over the Med. Are you fine with me going for one of your suppy points to make it look like we're fighting?",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: After Italy is finished I mean, we can coordinate it so that it just looks like I'm going for it but you can defend it.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Just something for the future.,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Right, it's possible but there are no convincing moves available at the time so really you could say that you're not in a good position for a stab",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Yeah, I think they want something later on",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Hey, it would've been much more helpful if you had used Kie to attack Ber. Now R has an extra CP for free :/ Should've spotted that as well.",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Imo, if you are doing a hold it needs to be with good reason",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: and Den couldn't have been pushed out anyway (you could've also tried moving to Swe, just in case.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: I was expecting russia to make an attack to be honest.,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: You making a push on Mun this turn?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: Because I get the feeling I'm about to get wrecked from the north and my best bet is to push through middle with you and cut Russia in half.,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: Yes, your support would be appreciated.",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: I'm moving in with Ruh,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: Done, got me just in time",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: Thanks!,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: You have any thoughts on moving forward?,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: I figure trying to push russia out from the middle while I go from the top? I can try to support you into Mun, but I will probably lose Kie.",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: I think it's too late for Mun now,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Bah, adjucation at noon hmm",0
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: Holland is safe for now but R has some crazy navy built up,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: Do you have something I can assist with?,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: Just hitting russia at mun or kie to put some pressure on fhem.,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-5] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: Et tu France?,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: Dear France, I have come up with a masterful strategy for world domination, and  while I can’t give you all of the details (for obvious reasons), suffice to say, it involves killing you *last*!  So whatever I can do to keep you strong and healthy so there is still a France to kill (or, heaven forbid, be killied by?!?), I’m at your service!",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: (Knowing whether to mark that as “truth” or “a lie” was tricky, when it should clearly be labeled “wishful thinking”, y’know?)",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: I must say, that was quite a mouthful to rate yeah.",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: Yeah, I'm a bit of a chatty Cathy.  You'll either get used to it, or convince all my neighbors to kill me to shut me up. ;P",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: I hope you do well, I have a sweet spot for Turkey",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: Well then we must both hope that Italy does *poorly*, in which case both of our hopes for each other doing well will be increased. 🙂",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: Not always... but usually.  It's probably been a while since I've been on a board where F, I, and T all did well.",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: I'm not even sure that is possible. Maybe in an extremely concerted effort.,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: But as it turns out, that would be fine with me in this case.",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: In my neck of the woods, we call it ""Care-bear"" play. 🙂",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: Speaking of Italy - they're the one I haven't heard from yet.  You?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: Nothing yet.,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: Could be talking to A a lot or just afk for now,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: Nobody I've talked to has heard from them, so I'm guessing the latter.",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: unless everyone is screwing with me already, which would be typical. 😛",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: I considered it.,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: Yeah, it'd be much more fun for all of y'all to say, ""Oh yeah, jeez, Italy just blabbers on and on!  Oh, you haven't heard from them?  How strange...""",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: It's fun but I want you to do well so no incentive for me to lie to you,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: Rockin'. Then lemme know when you *do* hear from them, and it'll let me know whether that happened before, or *after* they talked to me. 🙂",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: (and I'll give you the same info, natch)",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: Sure, would be nice for me to know if they are back",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: Nice defense over there.  It’s a fun start for France when you see moves to Eng, Bur, *and* Mar!  But even more fun when they are parried off 🙂",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: You have some... not fun guessing games for the fall though. I wish you luck in that!,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: Did Russia stab you in Bla? What's your feeling for alliances?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: Looks like Italy and A are friends maybe?,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: Russia told me they wouldn’t go.  I told them I wouldn’t go, but said I’d cover my ass.  Looks like I told they truth and they didn’t, but it’s not irreparable, at present.",0
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: I/A are friendly-ish.  The Rom-Ven means Austria will be covering Tri in fall.,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: Clearly E/G/I coordinated spring,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: I am ok with Austria.  I’ve actually done everything I said to everyone I’d do. Fat lot of good that’ll do me,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: I believe what you're saying but I'm hoping they will see their initial alliances are no longer in their best interest 🙂,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: it's hard to convince people though,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: If I go with A against R, it wouldn’t help you unfortunately: A shows no interest in anti-Italian early moves (which is sensible, if not ideal for you)",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: That's fine, I just kinda need to know how eveyone aligns with G",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: because it looks like an amazing game for them from spring,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: I’m trying to convince England that it would be super fun to coordinate the “convoy-Den” + GoB-Bal move,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: But I don’t get the impression they’re that creative,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: GoB? You mean let G get Swe while convoying into Den?,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: Maybe you should play hardball with Italy: “lay off me and if you’re my only neighbor who didn’t attack me, and I go down, I’ll give you my dots to spite them.  Attack me with them, and you’ll get Mar and nothing more ever, I’ll make sure of it!”",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: Yes that’s what I mean.,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: I love risky plays like that. Once got Sev in 1901, that was fun",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: Hah nice!,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: Tbf, Italy has a great position to attack Austria",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: Oh I love the Pie-Trl + Ven-Tri + build A ven combo, it’s great if you can get those all to work in fall",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: Just need some help from Russia, get them to tell Austria they feel they really *have to* go to Gal again, and they’re happy to bounce, but they simply can’t risk holding in fall...",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: Does a bounce from War help that much?,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to france: It’s irrelevant now, since Italy *did* attack Austria. Unfortunately for you: your position would be much better had Italy attempted Mar! 😦",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: Yeah, I had considered it but I had to cover my bases",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: Yep understood,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: Tricky situation... E/G finally fighting, and you lose Bur, but you really can't function with just one fleet, right?",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: But luckily for you, Germany doesn't seem to understand this game is about negotiation and alliances.  Do you think you can count on England to actually work with you?",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] france to turkey: I'm not sure but we share a common enemy,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] france to turkey: You know you could flip sides on the I/A axis and get half of the balkans probably right?,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] france to turkey: Nor do I want my right flank to succumb to austria,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to france: Succumb too Austria, succumb to me, six of one, half dozen of another, no?    But yes, A/I war is as fantastic for me as E/G war is for you.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] france to turkey: I don't see what you're gaining from this long term by letting R build back up. They seem intent to not anger G. So what then? Austria or you,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to france: Russia just took Sweden from Germany, with English help.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] france to turkey: That was a lost cause,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to france: I encouraged that alliance, helping break the E/G you and Russia were so keen to have broken up.  Now England and Russia are both mildly anti-German.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to france: Sweden was only a lost cause for Germany if they fought with England.  If they'd known how to be an alliance player, they'd have been offering to give centers to England to cement their alliance.  They didn't do that, and got stabbed for it.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to france: I don't understand people who play this game like it was gunboat.  The game is called diplomacy for a reason: make friends, use those friends to kill everyone off who doesn't have friends, try and convince other people to stop being friends with your enemies, and eventually kill your friends before they kill you.  Forget ""the board""... ""the dots"" - it's about *the people*",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to france: but yes, if I want to win, I have to stab a knife into someone.  Gotta break some eggs to make an omelette and all that.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to france: so from your perspective, you're worried about seeing Austria get too big, is that what I'm hearing?  Or Russia?  What worries you, now that E/G is probably not a thing, for the time being?",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] france to turkey: I see your assitance with Austria but I wouldn't want that to go too far because Italy's current position is unstable,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to france: Yeah Italy is ready to get pretty wrecked, unless Austria  or I decide to stop working together",1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: So you coming to prop Italy up, or get a piece for yourself?  We should talk, either way!",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: Right, I'm moving into the Mediterranean to get a better position for either case",1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: why did you not support Kie and cut Munich?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: Adjucation happened before I could think things through,1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: bummer. I never really get a chance to turn on Russia and slow them down if they keep growing so fast I never have an easy chance to stab... I'm doing my best to keep up with them at this point!,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: I'm happy to cooperate since they will be +3  on your supply now,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: I'm not quite sure what they would do by now but stab you or defend against a stab given that they have England in the bag,1
"[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: as long as you're not helping England, that's for sure!",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: That's true but I prefer to win,1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: Is that really likely on this board?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: I don't know but I'd love for us to work together to make sure we both have a shot,1
"[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: Tactically, on this board, England falls to Russia, and you can’t hold back my fleets without two fleet builds (but then you can’t hold Burgundy on land). If Russia stabs me before I stab them, they have a shot at 18 before 1910.  I could stab them but I have much a smaller chance at 18 in time. There is no way you can get that big unless you eat England alive from behind before they know what’s happening",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Winter] france to turkey: I don't really play with the deadline in mind. Kind of ruins it for me :p,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Winter] france to turkey: In any case, I'm not just gonna sit here and die a slow death.",1
"[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to france: Sure, so pick  direction which has a possible  good outcome: there are two powers  on the board  capable of totally overrunning your position, so the only option is to somehow play them against each other (by suggesting to one of the two that you’d intentionally make the other one win the game, for example, and be willing to follow through on it) or be willing to think outside the box and throw yourself fully at one power or the other in a last ditch attempt to get as big as you can in the time left.  This is a game of alliances - being willing to sacrifice your position for a chance at either winning or dying in the process is the only shot any of us have!",1
"[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: would you have time to be able to stab England if you had a build from Italy, and then we could get Russia to support you into Hol?  With two builds, you could perhaps quickly get to England and kill them fast enough to hold Russia back until I stabbed them in the east, and you worked to control the west?",0
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: I will try to talk to Russia and see how it goes. I just don't know if I can get a piece of Italy without arousing suspicion. Tunesia?,1
"[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: Tunis is now undefended, and yes, if you were to promise you'd use the build you got from that center to attack England, I'd be ok with you taking that - I'd focus on the two remaining Italian home centers I've got almost surrounded, and would also promise to stop hitting Marseille soo you could bring your Pie army back home to ensure Burgundy is still more safe in case Russia won't help you and keeps attacking Ruh to get to Bur.",0
"[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: But if Russia is willing to work with you, then yeah, you could get two builds, and you'd be back in this game, as you'd be able to get to Lvp/Lon before Russia could.",0
"[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: But if you don't feel comfortable with any of that, I'd understand.  You've gotta do what you feel safest doing.  Don't even feel like you need to tell me - I'll do the same either way: Italy has turtled-up pretty good, so it'll take most of my effort just too crack Rom+Nap.  You can ignore Tun or take it - your choice.",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: Sounds good. I'll use the Tun build to shore up my defenses with a fleet from Bre.,1
[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: Did you come to an arrangement with Russia which ended up feeling safe for you to try?  This game could get to a 12-12-10 three way draw if you can get into position to get Lvp and Lon with builds from Tun and Hol.  I *think* there enough seasons before fall 1910 to get there still...,0
[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: we still playing this game? 🙂,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: Yeah I thought about that,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: We'll see what happens with Russia...,1
"[SCORE:10] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: Yep.  I re-read my orders, and I'm crushing Rome and letting you have Tunis to build for the last few game years",1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: Ok, so where do you need to see my units to give you the breathing room to eliminate England by the end of 1910, so we can have a 3-way draw, instead of 4-way?",0
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: If we can DMZ some area between italy and me then that would free up my fleets,1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: You are in the more precarious position (although the game is time limited so the danger isn’t quite so great).  So you make a specific proposal and I’ll tell you if that is asking too much or is fine as long as you keep your end of the bargain.,0
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: If you left it up to me, I could say: I’ll park my fleets on Italian coasts and leave TyS empty, but keep Ion for defense",0
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: I normally make very specific proposals, so there's no ambiguity: if you are keeping two fleets in the Med, to protect Tunis, then I can offer to park Tunis on the coast, and do Nap-Tys, Rom-Tys (self bounce) and Ion-Tun (to cut your support so you can't do Tun S Wes-Tys to force Tys from me).  But if you have a different specific suggestion, I'm all ears.",1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: So what happens with Tys?,1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: F Tys parks in Tus in this proposal, as that’s the only space available for it that is not occupied",1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: I guess given your lack of response you don’t like any of my proposals or have any alternative ideas, so I’ll assume you’re *not* going to focus on getting rid of England.  That’s totally reasonable and within your rights, but then that means I have no reason to hold back, I guess.",1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: I am not attacking you at the moment but I also don't like the proposal.,1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: So do you have another one?,1
"[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: I can withdraw from Pie if you withdraw from Tys, but not to Tus.",1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: I'm not sure how I can make sure you don't attack Tys if I pull back without doing a self-bounce in Tys and Ion-Tun to make sure you don't support an attack on Tys?  If I pull back, and you do Tun S Wes-Tys, you'll get in.",1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: If Tus makes you uncomfortable, you could *stay* in Pie, as protection?",1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: That isn't much of protection since it would be easy to get through.,1
"[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: Tbf, in the long term you could push through anyway. But all I want is some buffer.",1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: Yeah, I get it.  I guess we could lock down on position a bit: Tys S Ion-Tun, Ion-Tun, Wes S Tun, Tun H, and that way I am not in Tus, and Tunis is locked down safely as well?  I wouldn't be pulling out if Tys in that case.",0
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: I think that's fair. Let's go with that,1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: Sounds good.  I'll go set my orders before we run out of time.,0
"[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: Yeah, time limits.",1

"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: So you do realize that both Bel and Hol can get taken this fall, right?  Russia can snap up English centers at their leisure, as England isn't bothering to defend anyways.",1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: And while you have no reason to trust me, Hol->Bel would mean you only lose one of those two, and since Russia has to do Mun-Ruh too cut Ruh S Hol, so if you counter-attacked: Bur s Ruh-Mun, you could possibly take Munich.",1
[SCORE:8] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: Seems like you do care about maintaining at least the status quo,1

"[SCORE:13] [SCORE_DELTA:6] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: So to be honest, Tunis isn’t something you can safely hold, with England still alive and Russia on your doorstep.  So unless you have a better offer, I’ll be using Lyo to force access to Tunis, since I basically loaned it to you in the first place to get builds to attack England.",0
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-6] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: I see, well it's true that England is about to fall",1
[SCORE:13] [SCORE_DELTA:6] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: At least this way you can focus on that direction instead of where it’s a losing battle.,1

"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] italy to turkey: Hey Turkey, Austria floated the idea of joint expansion into the Balkans. I'm not super interested in heading that way so not planning on supporting them",0
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to italy: Hmm ok they also told me that they wanted to keep you out of Greece so they lied to either you or I or I guess something has changed their mind.,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to italy: Looks like Russia is firmly committed South but Germany is gifting them Sweden plus England looks like they wont put up any resistance either. A runaway Russia looks likely. Do you plan to try for Greece?,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] italy to turkey: Only if you'd be willing to support - I'd hold it as the edge of my western expansion, but have no interest in going further. Do you know where Austria plans to go? Turkey-Italy alliance could push Austria north to face Germany and Russia.",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to italy: Yeah fair enough. I can't be sure of what Austria plans to do now as they seem to be spreading misinformation pretty liberally according to Russia. I will let you know if I'm in a position to support you into Greece. May need to try and keep Russia out of Rum. Would be more than happy to work together - I have no faith in what either Russia or Austria are telling me.,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] italy to turkey: Nice work in Rum! How deep does that Austria alliance run though?,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] italy to turkey: If you were to attack Ser, I would support",1

[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: Any news regarding what may be happening with Austria or Turkey?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Winter] france to italy: England went to the English Channel so I just wanted to give you a heads up that I am looking to build a second fleet in Marseilles that is NOT headed towards you,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Winter] france to italy: It would be really bad did Austria built an army in Trieste and supported it into Venice,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Winter] france to italy: You might want to consider an army in Rome if you are worried about that,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] italy to france: Appreciate the heads up re Mar,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] italy to france: Turkey-Austria alliance cuts me deep but hopefully isn't too long-term,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] italy to france: Any idea what England and Germany are up to?  Who are you closer with?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to italy: I think Germany plans to retake Munich. No idea what England plans to do with the channel.,0
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to italy: Turkey said he plans to flip sides and pursue a Russia Turkey alliance. I would definitely watch out for that,0
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] italy to france: Interesting, Turkey and I are going to team up against Austria.",0
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to italy: Cool. I do worry about Turkey getting so large. He seems to be very manipulative.,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] italy to france: FYI, moving into Tyr - Not trying to cause trouble, just trying to get better position on Austria",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: If you aren't doing anything with Tyrolia, can it support Ruhr to Munich?",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: I just looked closer at the moves. Darn, was the fleet in Rome supposed to be an army?",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: Turkey looks pretty aggressive and is positioned to take both Greece and Sevastopol this turn,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: Any new thoughts on moves?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: Do you have any Intel on Germany or England by any chance?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: Are we still good? I'm not sure what your silence means.,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] italy to france: Hey France, sorry was offline for most of Labor Day weekend!",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: No worries,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: I hope you got your moves figured out- not sure if you got my previous messages but if you are still around it would be nice to check in quickly,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to italy: We should talk about moves. I think it's vital that we work together against Turkey and so I'm hoping I might be able to help you with my fleet,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to italy: I would love to see you inTyrolia again. I'm trying to take Munich back,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] france to italy: We should definitely talk since Turkey just built a second fleet,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] france to italy: It would be a good idea I think to take the Adriatic and the Ionian, and I can be a third fleet to help you keep the Ionian.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] france to italy: I'm extremely worried about an Austria-Turkey alliance dominating the board, and a Turkey solo resulting from it. Adriatic will keep Venice safe for a very long time and also serve as a way to defend the Ionian. My fleet can also help with the defense if you so request.",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] italy to france: Agree - Trying to figure out how deep Austria's alliance runs. Think Turkey will have to swallow it sooner than later, so hoping to turn them to help contain",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] france to italy: Sounds good. I can tell you that the alliance is rock solid right now, and they probably will stay allies the whole game unless they get stuck",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: It looks like Austria was already trying to get into position to attack you since you bounced with them in the Adriatic Sea,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: Hmm. I wonder if it makes sense to support Ionian to hold this time since Turkey is in the Eastern Mediterranean. Austria might be worried about Venice-Trieste and not go to the Adriatic again,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: If you think that Turkey will stab Austria you could also ask him to support your convoy into Greeve,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: This is just a suggestion. But something to consider:
Ionian Sea C Tunis-Albania
Tunis-Albania
Venice-Trieste
Tyrhenian Sea S Ionian Sea H",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] italy to france: Turkey can just take Gre on its own,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: Damn. You would have been in such a strong position if you used the suggestion I gave you!,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: You would have taken Trieste for a build, you would have kept control of the Ionian Sea, andd you would have an army in Albania to take Serbia or Greece.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: I'm on your side- I'm trying g to help you. Iyou are prudent to distrust me, but it's us Vs Turkey and Austria right now. I'm trying to prevent a Turkish solo!",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: If I were you, I would retreat to Apulia",0
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: This is the only way to prevent Austria from taking the Adriatic for free. It also lets me help you with my fleet if you move Tyrhenian to Naples and my fleet moves to the Tyrhenian,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: Anyway, we're still in a great place due to some lucky guesses by Russia and Germany NMRing, so I'm going to help you as much as I can. Just ask.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: Would you be ok with me building an army in Marseilles? This would give me the option of moving to Piedmont with the goal of taking Tyrolia and helping you attack Austria,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to italy: Have you tried sending messages to me? If so, I am not receiving them.",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to italy: That could be the case if you don't mark the message with the thumbs up or thumbs down.,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to italy: I highly recommend that you move to Apulia to prevent Turkey from convoying a unit into that territory.,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] italy to france: Truly the hindsight is 20/20,0
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to italy: Yeah, that's one of the frustrating things about Diplomacy haha. Glad you are here- I'm moving to the Tyrhenian and to Piedmont right now to help out.",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to italy: Awesome moves this turn! What do you want me to do with Piedmont and Tyrhenian Sea? Any ideas for me?,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to italy: Not sure what your plan is, but I might be able to support you to Munich.",0
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: Any thoughts on moves?,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: I don't know what you are doing, but for now I am supporting Apulia-Ionian Sea and Piedmont-Tyrolia",0
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] italy to france: That's perfect and much appreciated!!,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] italy to france: How are your relations with England right now?,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: Hmm, I would say they are pretty tense, but still cordial.",0
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:7] [SEASON:Winter] france to italy: Sorry for changing the plan- I desperately needed the builds to have even a small chance of attacking England- just wanted to say that I have absolutely nothing else to gain from attacking you,0
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:7] [SEASON:Winter] france to italy: Your only threat at this point is Turkey, so If you keep Naples and the Ionian you will never lose Tunis or Naples and have a strong chance to pick up Greece",0
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:7] [SEASON:Winter] france to italy: If you keep the armies I think Turkey would get Tunis and Naples, and you would be eliminated and therefore not get paid the survivor prize pool money.",1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:7] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: Vienna is open if you move there,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:7] [SEASON:Fall] france to italy: I totally understand if you do- but I hope you don't bounce me out of the Tyrhenian Sea again so that I can counter Turkey,0
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:11] [SEASON:Winter] france to italy: You have every right to throw all your unts against me- but I hope we don't have to go that route,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to austria: Hello neighbor. We have quite an historic relationship. I hope we can keep the peace. Dmz tyrolia?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] austria to germany: Greetings my Germanic Brethren! Keeping the peace is definitely at the forefront of my foreign policy. Making Tyrol a DMZ sounds perfectly reasonable to me,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to austria: Excellent! :),1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to austria: Any further action you might want to take together?,0
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] austria to germany: Probably best to just stay on alert at the moment and respond to any threats as they arise,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to austria: Yeah sounds like a good plan :),0
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] germany to austria: Seems like you're playing it slow. I'm not sure if you've talked to turkey, but I think you've got a golden opportunity to move with him on Russia. What you do afterwards is your business",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] austria to germany: Not to cast aspersions, but what will you be doing should I move my forces to attack Russia?",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] germany to austria: Ohhhh haha no I'm not looking to move on you. I moved all my troops that opposite way. I think it's genuinely good for you (especially with Italy starting a Lepanto) and if Russia is busy it frees me up in the west. You see what I'm saying?,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] austria to germany: I did think that was your reasoning, but one can't be too careful! 😂",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] austria to germany: Is there any chance you could disrupt SIL for me this turn, or are you too caught up with the French and English?",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] germany to russia: Hello czar :) I think we should discuss a few things. A dmz of Silesia and Prussia would benefit us both. Let me know what you think. Also, there are plenty of joint risks to us both, particularly as the game progresses. Let me know if you've got any interest working together",0
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] germany to russia: Hm I'm getting your messages only in email form. Not to worry. Yes, I did say Prussia in my original message. I think the Baltic sea sounds fair enough as well. Why don't we work together toward those ends? I'm not shocked at the idea Britain might be looking to come for me",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to germany: Hi germany! Are you up for Sil as a DMZ? It would be in both of our best interests if we didn't get in a fight early on, as both of our great powers already have a lot to deal with on our sides of the map. Looking forwards to a great game!

"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to germany: A DMZ of Prussia and the Baltic might also not hurt. And if you're up to it, maybe even a potential alliance against England?",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to germany: I have heard some murmers of England wanting to attack you.,0
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] germany to russia: Also looking forward to a great game and a great alliance if we could hash something out :) did you get my earlier message in response to your last two messages I received by email,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to germany: I did. Are you thinking of forging an alliance with France? If so that would be great since me and France are already on really good terms.,0
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to germany: Have you gotten my messages?,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] germany to russia: Yes, sorry. Been a bit busy. Well, you say messages. Before the. Message asking if I got your messages (plural) I received one about allying with France. Him and I definitely seem to be on good terms and I'm not looking for war with him. If we can work something out, I would love to be able to work with him.",0
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to germany: That would be great. Me and France are and you could be powerful allies, especially later in the game",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to germany: I think France is being friendly with everyone,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] germany to russia: I can't say ik certain of how things will go in the west but I like to maintain peace as long as possible and a few allies I can trust is important as hell in this game,0
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] germany to russia: I think so too... Thoughts on that?,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to germany: Well they are probably pretending to be friends with everyone and then they will betray one or two...,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to germany: What’s your relationship like with England?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] germany to russia: Yeah. It's hard to trust him and he seems to be posturing for a move on Munich,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] germany to russia: I've been talking with England. I'm not really sure if it's positive or negative or if I trust him quite yet. Why do you ask?,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to germany: had a sorta anti-russian opening and just seeing who's on who's side,0
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to germany: I'm w/ Austria against turkey,0
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] germany to russia: Somewhat, but to be fair that's also a very common English open. I don't know if I if he's looking to make an attack and I'd be on my toes if I were you but I don't think it's anything catastrophic",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] germany to russia: I think that has an awful lot of potential for success. Best of luck in the south mate :),1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to germany: Thanks. Good luck to you too!,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] russia to germany: Thanks for sharing! Good luck over there in the west!,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] russia to germany: If you're interested, you could send some units over to the balkans and me/italy/you could try to take out Russia and Austria as they are allied now",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to russia: I don't completely understand the ask,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to russia: Also why are you moving on me man?,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to germany: Have you given up?],1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to england: I messaged you on backstabbr then I realized I don't think I'm supposed to do that 🤷‍♂️,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to england: So, basic gist was I think we have a lot of opportunity to work together and common interests, if you're open to it",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to germany: I am inclined to agree. How would you like to approach Scandinavia?,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to england: I'd like denmark, norways all yours. Perhaps we could move on Russia but I think we should start with france, otherwise he'll become a problem for us both. After that we can hash out the rest of scandanavia and Russia as it goes?",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to germany: Alright. Are we content to let Russia take Sweden with no contest?,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to england: If we put up a fight we'll have to go for Russia right away. If we did that, what would we do about France",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to germany: That's fair. I'm personally pro-leave Sweden to Russia but I wanted to double-check with you.,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to germany: What would you like to do against France?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to england: Alright. We'll leave it for now. I was hoping to get you into brest as soon as possible and then me into Paris and then decide from there? Likely you in Iberia and me in Marseilles but I don't want to count our chickens before they're hatched,0
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to germany: Alright sounds good.,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to germany: Hey what's the deal with France? They're talking about an alliance between us three to counter Russia and Italy?,0
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to england: He hasn't told me about that. An EFGs an interesting proposition... But idk. What do you think? And wdu mean what's his deal?,0
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to england: How do you want to open up? There are a lot of options and opportunities?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to germany: But he may just have figured we want to move west and tried to throw me off,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to germany: I ask because he said he already talked to you about it.,0
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to germany: I think I'm going to go EC to be aggressive on France, and take Norway",0
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to england: He also said he's working closely w france,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to england: Let's be aggressive with france so we can switch back to Russia asap,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to england: Hm yeah Russia also told me there were murmurs you wanted to attack me,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to germany: My only dialogue with Russia has been to advocate for the equal sharing of Scandinavia. I've been told that Russia seems to want to commit south.,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to germany: I suspect that France and Russia are both worried about two players moving on them early, and may be in an alliance to stretch us out.",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to germany: If Russia DOES want to commit south, it is logical that they'd try to prevent a united northern threat. Considering that Rus/Fr may be coordinating, I am going to play cautiously  and refrain from committing east or west",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to england: Russia admitted to me that he's in an alliance with france,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to england: He intends to move on you it seems, so I don't think he's truly committing south. Maybe just maintaining a hold. Either way time will tell",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to england: You told me you were looking to move aggressively against France. If we can get Russia distracted by turkey especially with Austrian help ik the south their alliance won't matter,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to germany: I was gonna play aggressive but i'm going to slow down to protect my expansion. I don't want to deprive myself of builds because I spread myself too thin,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to germany: I'm gonna to move to secure Norway, and maybe place myself to support you in Benelux or move against France next turn",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to germany: If Fr's fleet moves to secure Spain I'll go in,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] germany to england: Alright. Sounds fine with me. Just let me know of your intentions going forward so I don't end up acting alone. Seems like Russia is focused on the south which is excellent news for a move on France if we could just get Austria involved. He's playing awfully passive,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] germany to england: What happened with the Liverpool to London misorder last turn?,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to germany: Regarding France, are you trying to take Belgium? I would prefer to have it because otherwise you can get 3 builds and myself only 1",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to germany: it works on the website I normally play,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to germany: I'm not sure. I was under the impression I could move an army into a space that was becoming vacant,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to germany: oh I realize now that I'm a fool and it doesnt border. I wasnt paying attention putting down the move,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] germany to england: Lol yeah they don't border 😂,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] germany to england: And I hate to be so greedy to open up but I'm nervous that if I forego a build it opens me up to have Russia, France or both collapse on me and then we're really fucked. Particularly if France walks into Munich, I'll need both builds badly",0
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] germany to england: I'm more than willing to cede territory to you going forward when I'm better in a position to subdue France or Russia depending on what we've decided. Does that sound alright?,0
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to germany: It's really funny that you mention France and Munich.,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to germany: It just so happens that I've been talking to France, and they're under the impression that I'll bounce you out of Denmark if they march into Munich.",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] germany to england: Ah so he is moving into Munich? While I'd rather have that scenario not happen,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to germany: He may very well test my loyalty and let me try to bounce out of Denmark first, but he offered to march to Munich if I bounced you",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to germany: Btw have you talked to Italy?,0
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to germany: (my last message doesn't look to have sent correctly so I'll repeat),1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to germany: Have you talked to Italy? They might be helpful soon,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to germany: Anywho I'm gonna try to tie up the French fleet and take Norway. We can talk about territory later,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] germany to england: Well how would you like to work this one out?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] germany to england: And he hadn't responded in a while. Just messaged him again,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] germany to england: Alright so how are you looking to move and are you fine letting me have the three builds?,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to germany: I'm going Nor and EC. You can have your  3 builds rn, but I'll be expecting land later since you're getting two builds on me",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to germany: Also if France asks you about an alliance, we definitely had a convo about a loose 3 way alliance",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] germany to england: Alright excellent. Sounds good. We'll even it out. Promise that. I just want a healthy border around my home centers and a guarantee I can push back France,0
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] germany to england: Oh OK. So you and I had a convo about a loose efg?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to germany: Yeah. Just in case France tries to check,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] germany to england: Right makes sense,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] germany to england: But he attacked me so I'm moving in,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] england to germany: Alright that sounds good. Do you want me to move into Brest?,0
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] england to germany: Also what should I go about building?,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] germany to england: Go for it although hell probably build a fleet there,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] germany to england: Oh sorry missed this,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] germany to england: You built a fleet in Edinburgh? Why? I'd think you'd want it in London no?,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] england to germany: Yeah I was thinking London for a long time but I reached the conclusion that i would feel better with a fleet that could serve as a sort of home fleet, and I figured London served as a better base for attacks",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] england to germany: I'm not sure yet if its a good plan, but I figured no harming in trying it out",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] germany to england: I suppose so but Russia isn't gonna be able to come your way and we're supposed to be attack France rn so...,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] germany to england: Alright can we renegotiate? I'm not sure what France said to sway you. Was it the three initial builds? Cuz you can have Belgium. I'd just really prefer to knock out France. Belgium brest and Portugal can be yours. All I want is Paris and Italy can take Marseilles and Spain. Really we can really negotiate however I'd just rather not be at odds w you. Now I'd figure you'd much rather ally w me seeing as France has struck a deal w every nation I've talked to so far which makes him not that trustworthy and he has three fleets that can easily slip in your back door to my one that you have pinned on land... So if you head my way he's gonna walk in your back door. I would bet you money. What do you say? Can we strike some sort of deal?,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] germany to england: Le me know your thoughts,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to germany: I'm sorry mate. France's fleets are too big for me to piss him off. I won't push past Denmark, and if you can negotiate peace with him I'll respect it",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] germany to england: Alright. Understood,0
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] germany to england: I mean honestly mate he's gonna attack you either way. And the two of us can stop him... I'm not sure why you'd back off like that. I don't mean to be rude but how much experience do you have with this game?,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] germany to england: I'm saying honestly both cuz it's by far the most logical thing to do and he's in great position to do it now that he's advanced and you've completely backed off and cuz it's literally what he told me he was going to do,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to germany: What makes you say we can push him back if he has deals with everyone?,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to germany: If you surrender Denmark to me, I will help you survive France's push. I am not going to involve myself in this war for either side without immediately tangible benefits. France is a difficult invasion for me, and I've spent a lot of time in the North Sea with no new land.",0
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] germany to england: He doesn't have actual deals. Not ones people are intending to follow through on cuz they don't trust him cuz he makes deals w everyone. Russia doesn't trust him and is way too busy w Austria and turkey. Italy doesn't trust him either and I convinced him to invade the south although he's kind of a mess at the moment. I actually don't know if turkey or Austria has any sort of deal with france. And who is actually free to intervene against us?,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] germany to england: I'm not sure how you can make tangible benefits if you don't involve yourself though honestly. And if you help me out we'll topple France and how can I come attack you? Honestly. France is headed for you as we speak and is trying to sue for peace with me so that he can complete his invasion of you. Not to mention he has three fleets you just turned your back on. Please, listen to reason here. Either way, I'd much rather you take Belgium. Can we make that deal?",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to germany: Sorry about the delay. I'm willing to exchange Belgium for cooperation against France.,0
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] germany to england: Alright sounds good,0
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to germany: How should I move? I don't know how to handle his fleets,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] germany to england: Well moving out of the channel seriously set you back,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] germany to england: But we can fix this,0
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] germany to england: If you move to the north Atlantic, English Channel and North sea and your army to Wales you can cover your back side and set up a convoy route into France",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] germany to england: How's that sound,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to germany: I am not gonna go Nor Atl bcause I want a fleet in Nor, but the rest sounds good. France wants to move into Picardy this turn",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to germany: Also given how weird the western triangle has been, can I ask what you're going to do with your fleet? turning to face france leaves me vulnerable in that regard",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] germany to england: Oh I honestly don't know yet,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] germany to england: But I start the game w it and built two armies so I'm not exactly looking for naval dominance,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to turkey: We might have some space between us now, but it won't be long until we're on each other's door steps. You want to hash out a long term plan for cooperation?",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to germany: Hello and thanks for your message! I am certainly interested in your ideas on this. Have you heard from Italy or Austria at all yet?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to turkey: Not yet. Have you?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to germany: Nothing yet either.,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to turkey: Alright keep me updated,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to germany: I think Russia is committing south. Do you plan to bounce him out of Sweden?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to turkey: What makes you say that? And no not likely,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to germany: Well he has told me he wants to attack Austria. And Austria has told me that he told them that he wanted to attack me. If either of those are true then a 3 unit south start seems likely.,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to turkey: Hm understood. I think either way it might be in your best interests to jump on Russia. I can't right away but I can come help you later in the game,0
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to germany: Yeah, I guess you have France to worry about? Otherwise Warsaw would be a pretty easy option for you.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] germany to turkey: Yes this much is true. Once I figure out the west thought I think we're in a great situation to collaborate,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to france: I'm hoping we can come to a few agreements. Burgundy is a trouble spot for us both. Could we dmz it? I think at the worst, non agression would be in both our best interests, but I'd definitely be open to any proposition you've got",0
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to germany: Sorry for the brief message- I'll be available for more negotiation later today. I currently want to support Paris to Burgundy since I am not sure what everyone's plans are yet, and if it looks like we are in good position to work together in the fall I can use Burgundy to take Belgium.",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to france: No worries. Alright. I understand the move to burgundy but I think it should be obvious that any move into my territory would be met with aggression. Update me in the fall of your intentions?,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to germany: Thanks. Yeah, it's not that I don't trust you to DMZ Burgundy, but I can't think of a reason not to make the move honestly since it completely protects me against both you and Italy and still leaves room for us to work together. In that sense it leaves me some flexibility to decide my intentions in the fall- the truth is that I currently have no intentions and will let my targets pick themselves.",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to germany: What are your plans in terms of your moves?,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to france: It looks like we've already got ourselves a rat. I've heard rumors of Britain looking to attack me. Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm sure he's roped you in too. While, on the flipside he keeps trying to convince me to attack you alongside him. I think he wants to pit us against each other and use the opportunity to swoop against either or both of us. I think we should knock him out while we have the opportunity",0
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to germany: Yeah, I think you could be right about this. What would this look like? Do you think England will end up taking the Channel?",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to france: Has he contacted you? And I'm not sure. I don't think he'd be that aggressive right from the start. I can't say I know for sure. What do you want to do?,0
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to germany: England did contact me. I might be inclined to take the channel if Russia went to St Petersburg with an army, but at the moment I think it is better to wait and see",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to germany: (wait and see in terms of how to attack England),1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to germany: Nice opening moves. Are you going for Belgium? I was planning to head there from Burgundy but it looks like you are in a position to support yourself in anyway.,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] germany to france: Yeah. Like I said seems England wouldn't be so thoroughly aggressive for a first move. But we should keep an eye out you're right,0
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] germany to france: Thank you. Yeah I'd like to take Belgium. I hope there's no issue with that,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to germany: I am concerned over you getting 3 builds and would be a lot more comfortable with that arrangement if you build 2 fleets,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] germany to france: To be honest I haven't thought about builds. I'll build completely contingent on how everyone around me is postured. If you're not in position and russias not in a position to attack me considering two fleets is a lot more viable,0
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] germany to france: Now why would you do that my friend? Bad mistake,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to germany: I know it is an aggressive move, and I wanted to tell you about it but I couldn't risk not getting the additional build to put down 2 fleets and attack England",0
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to germany: I will be withdrawing from Munich immediately if you are willing to help with the assualt- I know what this looks like but I promise you will absolutely love my builds,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to germany: One more point. England proposed a plan to bounce you out of Denmark (but I knew he was lying about it),0
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] germany to france: See you could've gotten those two fleet builds with Portugal and Spain. You don't need the army in Paris unless you want to attack me. If you don't build your army in Paris and only build the fleets, we'll be fine. If you build the army in Paris it's going to mean war",0
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to germany: I can do that for sure, though it does mean slowing down potential convoys into England. What does this look like more broadly? Would you be willing to build a fleet in Kiel to take the North Sea? Does this mean you are letting me keep Munich so I can build a fourth fleet next turn?",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to germany: Also, we can get creative with my unit in Munich by sending it to Tyrolia to attack and/or help Austria",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to germany: I want to make this work to the point of potentially waiving a build, so I hope we can figure this out. Completely realistically speaking, I think EG struggles to take out F, and EF or FG has a much easier time just considering the distribution of builds. That's really important in a game that ends in 1910",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to germany: Another consideration is that England seems like the type of person to switch sides at a moment's notice, and there are some concerns regarding whether they can write orders without a misorder (given their turn 1 misorder)",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to germany: I think that The best way to do that is for you to build F Kiel and A Berlin, which I realize is a tough sell, but if we do that we can have 5 fleets on England's 3 and quickly roll over him",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to germany: No response?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] france to germany: I couldn't waive a build without hearing anything back from you,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] france to germany: It was written and I then changed my orders,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] germany to france: Yeah sorry thought I responded,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] germany to france: I can't really do a fleet build,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] germany to france: You understand,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] germany to france: I think we could work together but I definitely need you out of Munich and back to burgundy and then out of burgundy from there,0
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] germany to france: So let's work something out. What's the game plan?,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] germany to france: Why do you seem so determined to go after me? I have you at a stalemate that only England can break meaning he'll reap the rewards and Italy and England are both poorly defended. I honestly just want to know the strategic motivation behind it. Legitimate question. I'm curious what you see that I don't...,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to germany: I'll send Brest to English Channel and MAO to Irish Sea, but I need Belgium so that I don't go down a build.",0
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to germany: In regards to your question, wouldn't you agree that it is not me, but you who are committed towards attacking me? You built two armies and tried to take Picardy. Not saying we can't recover from that- but you left yourself no option to attack or defend against England. Whereas my 2 fleet builds can be used against England and are in position to do so.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] germany to france: Cuz you did what I thought you were gonna do. I don't want you taking Belgium and I need you out of ruhr which is one of the places I thought you'd go and is kinda an aggressive move. Now I'm not super interested in giving up Belgium to be honest but I'm not an unreasonable man. Let's negotiate.,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to germany: At the end of the day I need a dot, whether that's Munich or Belgium or something else. In return I'd push fleets into Irish, English, and MAO, which sets up a convoy into Wales. And I might try to persuade Russia to help you keep Denmark.",0
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to germany: On your end you should probably take the Helgoland Blight while you still can. That will make it especially hard for England to keep attacking you,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to germany: If the English fleet gets into Denmark and you aren't in the Helgoland, it becomes super easy for England to support themselves into hel and then convoy to Kiel,Holland,Belgium, etc.",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to germany: But if you are in the Helgoland all of a sudden they have to support Denmark to hol,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to germany: ""hold",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] germany to france: Alright I'll think about the move set and get back to you in the morning,0
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] germany to france: I don't see why you need a dot,0
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] germany to france: Just disband the troop in ruhr. That would have us certainly on peaceful terms,0
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to germany: Because you're asking me to use 3 fleets, 1 army (for a convoy), and lose a unit to attack England. When you've been super aggressive towards me with your builds and moves. I'm not going to attack England if you aren't willing to make any consessions.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] germany to france: OK I understand what you're saying. I'll think of something amicable for us both when I wake up fr,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to germany: Did you think of anything? Just curious.,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] germany to france: Oh sorry. I've been real busy,0
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] germany to france: Hold on,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to germany: I mean. One thought is to have me take Belgium this year and for me to give it to you back next year. That way you can build a fleet and I would be out of Ruhr as well (Ruhr to Belgium). And I'd use Belgium to convoy out,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to germany: You still there?,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] germany to france: Sorry,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] germany to france: Yes,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to germany: No need to apologise. I get that you are busy for labor day weekend. Just know that I need a real response before the deadline is over if you are serious about actually working things out. I'll be around for the entire rest of the day.,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] germany to france: I think that should be agreeable. Let me look at the map again,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] france to germany: Seems like you've lost interest in this game? I'd be upset if you weren't talking to me. But the truth is you aren't talking to anyone.,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] france to germany: If you've lost interest in the game you'll still get paid as long as you put in orders or until you get eliminated. I'd be happy to help you with either of those 🤣🤣🤣,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] france to germany: If you've lost interest in the game you'll still get paid as long as you put in orders or until you get eliminated. I'd be happy to help you with either of those 🤣🤣🤣,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] france to germany: The west (you me England) needs to figure our shit out before the East comes and rapes us,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to france: Yeah I agree,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to france: Sorry I haven't lost interest in the game it's just not on conspiracy so I don't think to periodically check this all,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to france: And the moves that got entered were from days ago,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to france: So let's work something out. I'd love for us to stop all the infighting and make an efg happen,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to france: That's what I wanted from the getgo,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] germany to france: Juggernauts coming though and regardless of if you are got buffer or not if you let that buffer go down in me and England it'll steam roll you just the same,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to germany: I'm thinking you want to move to Tyrolia and support Ruhr to Munich while I swing my fleets back south,0
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to germany: Ouch, England got you good.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to germany: I can help you,0
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to germany: You still around? If you don't make a very specific move you will lose 4 supply centers this year. No matter what, you will be losing at least 2 supply centers. It's up to you how much you actually want to stay in the game.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] germany to france: How would like to work together though?,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] germany to france: Hold on and I'll respond more in full,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] germany to france: Yeah I'm still here,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to germany: Well, I'm not actually sure what the orders are going to end up being, but what I can tell you are my current moves so that it can help you plan your defense. I'm moving to Ruhr and supporting myself to Belgium (no use in lying about that). So Ruhr's support, whatever it is, will be cut.",0
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to germany: I think it is safe to assume that Munich and Holland supports will also be cut,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to germany: So my recommendation to you if you want to stay in the game would be to use Berlin to support Ruhr to Kiel.,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to germany: I tell you this with little risk since if you tell England, he'll simply change the plan to one without this key vulnerability",0
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to germany: Now, you have reason to mistrust me, but the truth is that I have 3 fleets and only 2 armies. I stand to gain the least from continuing to attack you. And my largest concern is a Turkey/Russia or Austria/Turkey alliance, which is where I plan to put my focus. I intend to let England and Russia squabble over your supply centers while I move fleets south to help out Italy",0
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to germany: And with Russia taking Munich, your survival means that we could coordinate to take it back in the case of a Russia/Turkey alliance.",0
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to germany: So it looks like you really have given up,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to germany: I know things are looking bleak, but if you are willing to entertain me for a bit I have a plan that might keep you alive, and thus get a slice of the $24 pool for survivors.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to germany: Just to make sure you see it- the plan would involve you retreating to Tyrolia and capturing an Austrian supply center,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to germany: Whatever the case, I highly encourage you to stick it out because that way you'll get paid",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to germany: So.... ?,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] austria to russia: Hello, Russia! I hope we can both agree that peace between our nation's would be beneficial for the both of us?

I'd like to suggest that in return for letting me into Romania, you will have my support should you wish to expand into Scandinavia",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to austria: Hi Austria! I can definitely agree that peace between our nations would be good for both of us! Unfortunetly I can't agree to letting you have Rumania, as that is basically the back door into Russia. If you do try to take it, then there is going to have to be war between our two great countries. Also I don't see how you could really support me into Scandinavia... But that besides, I think we would both benifit from an alliance against Turkey. What do you think about that?",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] austria to russia: In that case, I will keep out of Romania if you do the same, we'll keep it as a DMZ?

I'll admit my promise to help you with Scandinavia was a little optimistic, but do excuse me as I'll blame it on a tad too much Austrian beer.

We should keep an eye on Turkey, but I feel as though an alliance this early on will not leave us in the best of standing with the rest of Europe.",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to austria: If were going to have an alliance, we should aim for blitzing turkey. It's the power triangle; Austria/Turkey/Russia. Only one of them is going to survive very long. Also, what is your relationship with Italy looking like? Just a note: I am willing to work out an agreement of who gets what part of the balkans, but I am taking Romania. It is essentially part of Russia and leaving it as a DMZ just will not do if Turkey goes for the Black Sea",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] austria to russia: I will give you Romania as long as we can take out Turkey asap

Should we start this turn?",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to austria: Ofc we should start this turn.,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] austria to russia: I'll push down to Serbia and continue to push from the south,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to austria: O.k. Can you trust Italy? How is your relationship with them?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] austria to russia: I have not yet spoken in any great detail with Italy and am waiting to hear back from them,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to austria: Alliance against turkey is still on right?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] austria to russia: Of course. I heard back from Italy as well and we seem to be on the same wavelength,0
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to austria: Why did you only move 2 units? Also turkey told me that u told him that I was going to attack you? What was that about?,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] austria to russia: Don't believe Turkey, I said nothing of the sort. I imagine he's just trying to cause an upset between us.",0
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] russia to austria: 😭 that was mean,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] russia to austria: Oh well,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] austria to russia: Awfully sorry, old chap. But all's fair in love and war",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to austria: I know you and turkey probably have a nice and cozy alliance right now. But despite your betrayal, I still think we could have a very powerful alliance that would be able to crush turkey within a year or two. If we got Italy  involved, I'm sure we could figure something out where, for example you support me into Rum, and Italy supports you into Bul.",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to austria: Hi austria. Turkey told me you're alliance is over. Is that true?,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to austria: It looks like you're alliance has ended. And before long, one of us in the east will be elliminated. I say we work together to make that someone be turkey",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to austria: What do you think?,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to austria: They told me they are interested in working with me against you and are going to try to take Ser. So what I think we should do is you attack Rum with Bud and Gal, which would cut support and let me take Sev. That way we get two of Turkeys territories, which would be a big blow to them",0
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] austria to russia: Do you have any proof to these claims?,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] austria to russia: At the same time however, it does seem plausible that Turkey will move on Serbia",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] austria to russia: I'll do it,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to austria: No proof... unless I took a screenshot ig... but I feel that goes against the spirit of the game,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to austria: Good luck!,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] austria to russia: No, I wouldn't expect you to take a screenshot, it's alright",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to austria: Ok,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] austria to russia: If you can do Moscow S Sevastopol H and Galicia S Ukraine-Rumania this turn then we can most likely take Romania,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to austria: Yeah. France told me about the orders you sent me,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] austria to russia: Thoughts?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to austria: I like them. Are you on board?,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] austria to russia: Aye,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to austria: If this alliance works out(and I hope it does) we will have turkey dead pretty soon🙃,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] austria to russia: I stabbed you in the back once already, I owe you this one 😉",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to austria: Thx,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to austria: Although technically, you're the one getting Rum 😩",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] austria to russia: I've been short changed by Turkey, I need it at least for now 😅

Once we start pushing him back, you can take some of his cores",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] austria to russia: What are you plans for after Turkey?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to austria: Not sure yet... Italy maybe? What about you?,1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] russia to austria: If i get a build, in the fall I can build a fleet in Sev to further our attack on turkey. What are you planning for moves?",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] austria to russia: Do you think that maybe we should turn our attention to France? They'll be running away with it before long,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] russia to austria: Yes. we probably should,1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] russia to austria: hey, any plans for this turn?",1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] russia to austria: ig ur prob going for bul, correct> Do you mind if I have RUM? I would support you  into bul from there if u did't get it this turn",0
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] russia to austria: or support u somewhere else if u did,0
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:6] [SEASON:Spring] russia to austria: Hey, I'm assuming our alliance is over? I wanted to keep it going but didn't get anything from you.... If you want to I think furthering our alliance would still work, and I could help you fight france and also give u rum back(in exchange for helping me w/ turkey)",0
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-6] [SEASON:Spring] austria to russia: Sorry, I've been swamped with work recently. France is our biggest threat at the moment and I think Turkey believes the same",1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:6] [SEASON:Spring] russia to austria: Ok. So what do you want to do?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-6] [SEASON:Spring] austria to russia: I figure there's not much we can do to stop him from pushing in the north unless you're able to stop him from getting those SCs yourself. I'm pretty tied up in the South and reckon I'll be out soon enough. We just need to try and stop him slowly eating his way up to 18,1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Spring] russia to austria: Hey austria. Long time no see. Sorry for the stab earlier. I think we should try to work together to stop france from winning; if we work together we can stop france from getting 3 more centers, and then we will all win in a 3, 4, or 5 way draw when the game is hard-capped at 1910",0
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Spring] russia to austria: I know you probably don't want to work with me, but if you want for it to be a win (including you) then we should definitly work together",0
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Spring] russia to austria: Vie, bud or ser moves to tri w/ the other two supporting",1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Spring] russia to austria: Can bud and ser support me into tri, and I will give u ven next turn? I think that would be best since support can't be cut",0
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Spring] russia to austria: Austria?????!!??,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:5] [SEASON:Spring] russia to austria: I really need an answer,1
"[SCORE:2] [SCORE_DELTA:-5] [SEASON:Spring] austria to russia: Apologies for no response, I am in a different time zone 🙃",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to austria: Hello Austria!,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to austria: I believe we  may have shared interests on the eastern half of the map,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] austria to england: I do believe you are correct,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] england to austria: Hello!,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] england to austria: If you don't mind me asking, are you getting along with your neighbors?",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] austria to england: I believe I am at the moment, apart from Russia that is...

How are you faring?",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to austria: I am in quite the situation right now,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to austria: Being caught in the western triangle is not my cup of tea. That said, things aren't going too poorly",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to austria: Hey Austria! How's it going? I am hoping we can work together on this one. No point getting into any early conflict which will only serve to help everyone else. How do you like to split up the Balkans?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] austria to turkey: Hi Turkey! I fully agree that we should stay peaceful with eachother. How do you like the sound of you getting Greece and Bulgaria and I'll go for Romania and Serbia?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to austria: That sounds good. If we stick together we can get through this early game intact. What's your read on Russia and Italy? Have you heard from them?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] austria to turkey: Haven't heard from either of them yet unfortunately,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to austria: Ah well our biggest issue is keeping Russia out of Rumania. I will see if they have plans to move most units south. It sounds like they might be.,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] austria to turkey: Russia is planning to take you out as soon as possible, and is asking me to help. How do you feel about moving against Russia, as I believe that he will be the biggest threat to the two of us. He is really posturing in his communications with me",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to austria: Sure, that makes sense. Like I said, first thing would be  to keep Russia out of RUM, whether that be by supporting yours or my army in.  Italy is pretty quiet but what I did hear from him was fairly anti Austrian by the way. I believe they are probably pretty tight with Russia, them being natural allies anyway.",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to austria: Well I'm getting the same sort of stuff from Russia that you have. They are indicating to me that they will commit south and want to attack you directly with my help. I have told them I'd consider it but know that I am firmly locked in to working together with you. Looks like our neighbours have made the decision for us really which makes it easy right?,0
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] austria to turkey: I'm quite happy to support you going into Romania as I can imagine that I'll need my forces to fend off Italy. Will you be moving up to Bulgaria this turn and go onto Romania from there?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to austria: Ok yes let's do that and I can support you into Greece the following year if you don't get it this year.,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to austria: Just confirming that you will support my BUL army into Rum this season? Looks like Russia is firmly committed South but Germany is gifting them Sweden and England looks like they wont put up any resistance either so we better not let them take RUM as well or they'll be running rampant in no time.,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] austria to turkey: I can confirm that I will definitely be supporting you into Romania.

Russia has been trying to sow doubt between us by telling me that you told him that I plan to attack him",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] austria to turkey: Nicely done! I reckon we've got Russia on the backfoot now,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to austria: Yes, nice one. I'm glad we could sort things out. Next is to get you into Greece then we'll have secured our front and can go from there. Russia does have three on RUM but we can fend that off together and Warsaw for you and Moscow for me can be the mid-term goal. What do you think?",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] austria to turkey: Sounds like a plan. I'll support Rum this turn and move down into Greece,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] austria to turkey: Ah, I didn't see that Italy was in Greece. Would have been wise to check the map before sending messages",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to austria: Haha yeah well we can knock him out of there if you like, either in the spring or fall, he can't stop it since he built that fleet in rom...",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] austria to turkey: What do you want me to do in regards to Russia?,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to austria: We can support your bud army into gal. I think that would be best. So I support you into gal and support ser army into Greece. If it works out for spring I mught be able to get a convoy in in fall but that's probably a next year thing.,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] austria to turkey: Yeah okay, that works",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to austria: Hmm we might need to change our plans. I think Russia is planning to go to sil anyway. Still on for Greece though. What are you going to do about tri? Can you trust Italy not to go for it?,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to austria: Yeah i think best to support you into Greece in the fall. Just need to hold in rum this season. If you can still support me in rum that would be appreciated.,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] austria to turkey: Roger that,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] austria to turkey: I'm not sure if going for Greece this turn is entirely preferable as Italy said they plan to move out and it might be better not to provoke them quite yet,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to austria: Ok good call,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to austria: Well looks like Italy messed it up. Anyway thanks for the support. Looks like I did need it after all. What do you want to do this season?,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] austria to turkey: Now Italy has moved into Tyr, which we agreed was a DMZ so if you could support Ser in Greece that'd be much appreciated. What do you want to do Vis a vis Russia?",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to austria: No problem, I will support you into Greece. If you can attack gal to cut the support there and support me in rum that would be great. All going well we get one each. Do you think Italy will be getting out of Greece though anyway?",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to austria: Actually don't worry about supporting in rum, just the hit on gal should do it.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to austria: Just confirming that you still need my support into Greece? And can still hit gal for me?,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] austria to turkey: Yes for both,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to austria: Italy claims to be moving out of Greece. I might need to pull the support. I'm being told that you and Russia might be attacking me instead 😟,0
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to austria: Meh I'll trust you over them. Ill keep the support locked in. If you and Russia wanted to take rum you could do it. Then we would be bogged down for the foreseeable future and that would just help the West. We have the jump on the west at this point so I'll hope you're still on board for that reason.,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] austria to turkey: Russia and I haven't been in contact since I first betrayed him. May I ask who told you this?,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to austria: Italy was suggesting it more than saying it but they got me a bit paranoid anyway,0
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] austria to turkey: Now there's something. Italy was suggesting that he and I go against you,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to austria: Yeah I'm not surprised. He was also offering me support into Serbia. We can stick to our guns here and easily take Russia and Italy. Ive got the paranoia in check now.,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] austria to turkey: Aye, Russia was also asking me to turn on you but we've got a good thing going here",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] austria to turkey: Russia has asked me to work with him and Italy (don't know for sure that they are in cahoots yet), and suggested that he support me into Romania and Italy into Bulgaria. This is of course, not possible now that Italy had retreated from Greece.

I was wondering perhaps if I should string Russia along, so that we may know his moves?",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to austria: You could definitely do that if you like. We will know more once we see where Russia builds,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to austria: I suspect Italy and Russia would be working together at least at some level. They are obvious allies. We have the jump on both of them now though,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to austria: So I was thinking I would push into UKR this year and then MOS. Depending on how things go, I can support you into WAR and go for MOS next year. IF you can support my RUM army to UKR and Russia covers WAR then the UKR army will have to disband. Also you can perhaps take the ADR? If you get it, we can get ION in the fall. What do you think?",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] austria to turkey: Done and done. Supporting RUM - UKR, Disrupting BOH and hopefully taking ADR",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to austria: What do you want to do for this one? We should probably repeat our fleet moves. This time we would get one or the other,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] austria to turkey: If you can disrupt UKR, I'll stop BOH and see if Germany could hit SIL and then I'll move GAL into WAR, which will deprive Russia of a build",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to austria: Ok have locked that in,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to austria: Might need to shift tack a little bit. Would love to break through into Russia but maybe we need to make ground into Italy first?,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] austria to turkey: Aye, we seem to be in a bit of a stalemate at the moment",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to austria: Ill come in to the ADR so don't go there with your fleet. Also I will support your army in GAL to UKR - that might get us somewhere. But I guess we will have a new army in WAR to worry about. Will check again after the builds.,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to austria: It wont be worth it. You just get to be the second target for Russia and Italy. If you want to turn it around, let me know",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to austria: Although since Germany has given gifts to everyone and England has essentially stopped playing this game has deteriorated into pointless territory,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] austria to turkey: It has gotten rather back and forth,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to austria: Well you've given up your best ally for... well... nothing? Are you going to follow through as Russia's Puppet?,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] austria to turkey: Honestly, at this point I don't even know. Fancied a little shake up as the game was getting a bit stale",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to austria: Yeah I get that. If you can convince Russia to worry about the main threat - France. Call a truce and you and I can both try and hold France back. If not, I will obviously just help France take it out for the price of my survival. I don't really mind either way",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] austria to turkey: Will see what Russia has to say,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to austria: Russia should be moving to Boh and Sil, you and I should get into ION and TYS, knock Italy out because why not. However, if Russia doesn't move his armies west to Boh and SIL or he moves MOS to UKR, it will be pretty obvious that he's just going to take you out.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] austria to turkey: I do reckon he'll try to come after me after I betrayed him at the start,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to austria: If you want, I can support you into SEV. Up to you.",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to austria: And now there's support for you into Rum if you want it.,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] austria to turkey: Aye, from Serbia if you could",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to austria: Done,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] austria to turkey: Reckon you could disrupt Romiana?,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to austria: Yup, done",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] austria to turkey: Ta,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: Hey Austria,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: I wanted to ask if you knew about Italian intentions. I don't think he plans to move to Piedmont, which could be an indication that you want to play defensively.",0
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] austria to france: I have not yet heard anything from Italy unfortunately.,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: What are your thoughts in terms of your moves?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] austria to france: Just looking to secure my borders at the moment. You?,0
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: Yeah, I'm looking to secure my borders as well.",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to austria: What are you thinking now?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to austria: (In terms of working with Italy/Russia/Turkey),1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] austria to france: Naturally, I don't want to give too much away but I reckon you'll be able to tell soon enough",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Winter] france to austria: Very interesting moves,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Winter] austria to france: You've done well getting 3 builds this season! May I ask if you have made any alliances?,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Winter] france to austria: I have no chance of keeping Munich and England is in the channel, so it's honestly a less than ideal situation.",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Winter] france to austria: I was planning to work with Germany, but it seems like they plan to attack me now that I took Munich.",0
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] austria to france: Ah yes, that it's unfortunate",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: So. What exactly is going on in your region? It looked like you and Turkey were buddies but those Turkish builds aren't that ideal for you I think.,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: I am very worried about a steamroller/Russia Turkey alliance,0
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] austria to france: I must admit that I am worried that Russia and Turkey are in cahoots, and Russia let us take Romania so that I'd trust Turkey for them to then turn on me and push West",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: I think it's the most likely explanation for A Warsaw. If Russia was worried about Turkey, wouldn't they build A Moscow? Likewise, if Turkey intended to take Sevastopol. Wouldn't A Smyrna make more sense to capture Armenia and then Sev?",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: I think it's the most likely explanation for A Warsaw. If Russia was worried about Turkey, wouldn't they build A Moscow? Likewise, if Turkey intended to take Sevastopol. Wouldn't A Smyrna make more sense to capture Armenia and then Sev?",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: By the way. I was wondering for the longest time about you and Italy's moves. I won't tell anyone. But is the plan to convoy Venice to Tunis?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: That's freaking awesome if so,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: Not sure if it is the best plan if Russia and Turkey are working together. The army could be needed more in Albania,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: By the way. Any suggestions for me in the north? I've been hearing different things from Germany and England so I'm at a bit of a crossroads in terms of who to trust and what to do.,0
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: Well, I found an ally since I think Russia will move to Silesia to pull some German units away from Munich",0
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] austria to france: I haven't heard from England or Germany on why they plan to do unfortunately,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: No worries. Hopefully you have things figured out with your neighbors. I think Turkey is sowing a lot of discord between Russia, you, and Italy to his own advantage",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] austria to france: Aye, he is most likely up to something",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to austria: You need a build this turn,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to austria: Whatever you do, don't let Turkey take Greece AND Sevastopol",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to austria: Any updates on your plans regarding Turkey?,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to austria: I will tell you this. In the first year, Russia told me he was working with you against Turkey. Somehow, when the orders were read, Turkey had convinced both you and Russia to work with him.",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to austria: So it seems like Turkey has been playing both sides from the start.,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to austria: I'm not trying to be super nosy, and I apologize in advance if I am coming off that way, but for my long term interests it is pretty important that Turkey doesn't start explosively growing and wiping out half of the map. Any chance you and Russia can figure things out to recapture Rumania from Turkey?",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] austria to france: Russia won't work with me on this unfortunately,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to austria: That's too bad. Is it like he is not responding to you, or he flat out refused?",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to austria: Because it is possible that he has been MIA for the past few days,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to austria: Any Intel on England or Germany?,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] austria to france: England is worried about being caught in the middle of you and Germany. And Germany is just happy that we've tied up Russia,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to austria: Cool- makes sense. It has been very quiet lately, which is concerning me greatly.",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] austria to france: I think that's just because it's the weekend. I imagine it'll pick back up once orders start going through,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] france to austria: Russia was not responding due to the weekend and he said he would be extremely enthusiastic to work with you.,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to austria: Looks like you are in good shape. I'd watch out in case Turkey intends to stab you for 2 (Serbia and Greece),1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to austria: So. What are your thoughts on this game right now?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: Are you attacking Italy?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: I love to see you working with Russia against Turkey. I'm assuming a retreat to Ukraine with the idea of taking Rumania?,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: By the way, what is your plan with the Adriatic Sea? Will you be fighting Italy?",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] austria to france: That was mainly to stop Turkey getting a foothold there,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: It might work in our favor actually if the plan is to dislodge Turkey from the Ionian- we have a total of 4 fleets to his 3.,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: Looks like:
Ukraine-Rumania
Moscow S Sevastopol H
Budapest S Serbia H
Serbia S Ukraine-Rumania
Galicia S Ukraine-Rumania

will guarantee you Rumania",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: What is your relationship with Italy like? I thought you two were fighting by bouncing in the Adriatic so much 😅,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: I'm happy to help the cause and I've told Italy my moves each turn, but I still feel like I don't know what the plan is here. (Is there even a plan?)",0
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to austria: Thoughts on moves?,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Winter] france to austria: This game is going very well for you. You have zero threats and allies all around you. You are highly likely to take Bulgaria and/or Greece this year,1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Winter] france to austria: We should talk about borders- if you can move your fleet from the Adriatic to Albania it would help you capture Greece, and I'd have no problems staying out of Tyrolia and Trieste if you are willing to do the same.",0
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: Thoughts?,1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: Not sure why Italy disbanded Ionian, but I figure he may have missed the deadline for builds",1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: We need to move quickly if we still want to get the edge on Turkey,1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: Also, any thoughts on Russia?",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] austria to france: I'm fine with keeping out of Tyr and Tri to maintain a dmz between us

I'm not 100% sure about Russia at the moment, I feel as though as soon as Turkey is gone he will move against me",1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: Sounds good. I agree, I would definitely not leave yourself open to being stabbedd by Russia if possible",1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: It looks like you are aiming to take Venice? Meanwhile, Turkey has a walk into Tunis and will only get stronger. Maybe we should try to cooperate instead of fight?",1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Fall] france to austria: What gives with the move to Trieste?,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Fall] austria to france: Ngl, completely forgot about it being a dmz. I'm not attacking you dw",0
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Fall] france to austria: Ok- I can trust that since I think taking the Ionian and/or Albania is a priority for you,0
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:9] [SEASON:Winter] france to austria: Damn- I seriously did not intend to take Trieste. I had figured I would want to stay in Venice for the time being with you bordering it with two units and didn't think I would actually end up there,0
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:9] [SEASON:Winter] france to austria: If there is absolutely anything I can do to help you with my army in Trieste, it's your unit to order",0
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-9] [SEASON:Winter] austria to france: I guess just pull back to Venice?,1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:9] [SEASON:Winter] france to austria: Sure- especially if Italy keeps Piedmont, that might be the move. I am also happy to help support Budapest to hold so that you don't lose it to Russia. Speaking of which, I am assuming you are disbanding the Adriatic Sea? It doesn't seem to be very useful since Turkey will be able to keep it out of the Ionian anyway.",0
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:9] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: Any more thoughts now that builds have been put down?,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-9] [SEASON:Spring] austria to france: If you can support a hold in Budapest, could I take Venice for the time being? I'm getting rather weak as it goes",1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:9] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: I feel like you should have kept Albania instead of Adriatic. Putting the fleet in Venice only moves us backwards,1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:9] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: I can't stop you from moving to Venice though I do feel like you are better off putting it on the front lines,0
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-9] [SEASON:Spring] austria to france: Disbanding Albania was a mistake, I'll admit",1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:9] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: I was assuming a move like that meant you might be working with Turkey again, which would probably be a huge help for you",1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:9] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: Darn, we weren't on the same page last turn, but I'm super glad to see you work with Turkey again",1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:9] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: Russia is in a really good position to wipe you off the map so I would definitely try to slow him down. I'll do what I can in the North,1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:9] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: Just as a sidenote, I noticed you held in Budapest, but it could have potentially supported Serbia to Rumania.",1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:9] [SEASON:Fall] france to austria: Sorry, the bot was down for a short bit. If you support Budapest to hold with Serbia and Turkey cuts Rumania, you'll keep Budapest: otherwise you probably will lose it to Russia",1
[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:13] [SEASON:Winter] france to austria: Congrats on keeping Budapest!,1
[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:13] [SEASON:Winter] france to austria: We can definitely keep pushing back Russia,1
[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:13] [SEASON:Winter] france to austria: Turkey and Russia both told me that they want to eliminate you and England and go for a 3 way draw,1
"[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:13] [SEASON:Winter] france to austria: I'm not sure I'm very interested in that because we only just started making progress against Russia, and Russia/Turkey alliance is always scary and may be able to overpower me in the long run (they don't want to give me any of the builds)",0
"[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:13] [SEASON:Winter] france to austria: Would you be willing to support Tunis to the Ionian Sea in the Spring? Also, I can give you Trieste in the fall in exchange for Vienna if that's alright with you.",0
"[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:13] [SEASON:Winter] france to austria: Oh crap, you have a disband",1
[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:13] [SEASON:Winter] france to austria: Not sure what the best disband is. Probably either Budapest or Adriatic,1
"[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:13] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: I think:
Budapest-Rumania
Serbia S Budapest-Rumania

 Gives you the highest chances of surviving from Russia/Turkey onslaught this turn",1
"[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:13] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: And actually, Serbia-Albania would ensure Turkey cannot outflank us",1
"[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:13] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: Darn, if you had moved Budapest to Rumania you would have kept Serbia 😩. GG",1
"[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:13] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: wait wait wait, you can retreat Serbia to Greece!",1
"[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:13] [SEASON:Spring] france to austria: If you retreat to Greece, I'll support you back into Serbia.",0
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] england to russia: Hello Russia, I am curious as to whether or not you would be content to split Scandinavia equally between yourself, Germany, and me. Does that prospect interest you?",0
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to england: Hi england! I'm assumimg that you're planning on heading to Nwy, and Germany would go to Denmark. If we could share that would be great! I would preffer if you went there with a fleet instead of a unit. I would be willing to give you unaposed access to Nwy if you agree to this (I won't move Mos-Stp, then Stp-Nor for a stand-off). Looking forwards to a great game with you!
-Russia",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] england to russia: Hey! That appears to be how things are going. I'll move my fleet into Nwy and we can have a grand ole time. Cheers and good luck!,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to england: You too!,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to england: Hey. Whats up with that anti - Russian start?,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to russia: Apologies. Not trying to counter you. I'll be taking Norway like I said but, and the other fleet is to pressure Benelux",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to england: Ok. that's fair. It is a pretty typical opening now that  I think about it. As long as you don't convoy your army across, we should be good/",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] russia to england: Thx for sharing! Good luck over there in the west!,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] england to russia: My dearest Russia,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] england to russia: I have a weird request,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] england to russia: We share an Iberian ally, and that ally would love it if we took denmark this turn. Would you be willing to support SKA into denmark next turn? My Norway fleet will be heading south.",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] england to russia: Rather took denmark next turn*,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to england: Ummm... ok?,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] england to russia: Lol I know it's weird. You can talk to France to verify,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to russia: Alright just a reminder to support Ska into Denmark so I don't bounce. I'm moving one of my fleets into Nor just because its not good form to leave an undefended supply center, but the denmark fleet will move west soon so we'll be back to one fleet each in the region",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to england: I'm a bit confused here. I'm willing to help you take Denmark, but I am going to need something in return. I love the alliance between you me and France, but taking Denmark doesn't really benefit anybody but you. I would be willing to support you into Denmark, if  you move your fleet in the Norwegian west. I really don't like the look of all three of your fleets hovering over Scandinavia. If I support you into Denmark, and you move your fleet west, we will both have one troop in that area.",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to russia: Alright. That works for me.,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to russia: Is NWG to Edi good enough for you?,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to england: Yea, sure. Thanks for cooperating",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to russia: Awesome no problem.,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to england: Wait up. I'm assuming I'm supporting Ska into Denmark?,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to england: I'm thinking of moving to Sil. If you could move into Hel, me, you, and franc could crush germany",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to russia: Correct on supporting Ska.,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to england: I think our alliance with France has great potential.,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to england: and north to Helgoland?,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to russia: And I'm bouncing North Sea in EC but I am down to move there next turn,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to russia: Also I agree with our triple alliance. That will be very helpful for everyone,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to england: Why would you bounce? Hel is a much more powerful postition,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to russia: I'm not exactly sure but France proposed it and I'm rolling with the flow,0
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to russia: ?,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to england: Sorry. I really am. I hope our alliance can maybe continue?? I was talking with France and a ton of the stuff didn't match up, and I was worried you would attack me. I should have let you know, as it is clear you only told the truth.",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to russia: What didn't match up?,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to england: Stuff like the bounce in English Channel,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to england: But what if I move out of Norway and let you get it back. Could that  save our alliance?,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to england: Ok, I need to go now, but we can talk in the morning?>",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to russia: Yeah let's talk then.,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] england to russia: Hello. If you leave Nor this turn our alliance will survive for the time being.,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] russia to england: Again, sorry for the stab. In hindsight, I can't really say it was a mistake. Even though I feel bad I REALLY needed the build as Austria and Turkey are running a relentless attack against me. I appreciate you're cooperation. I fear if we go to war, I will be pressured from all sides and will be eliminated. But, that would probably also end the alliance with you and France, and they are looking in a much better position then you right now. So I would really like to continue our alliance. I will move out of Nwy this turn, provided you don't take Sweden.",0
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] england to russia: If I have Norway and Denmark I am content.,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] england to russia: Lovely. I have been talking to france, and in the interest of keeping you strong to fight Austria and Turkey, I surrender any german centers except Denmark to you",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] england to russia: I don't blame you for stabbing me, because it's reasonable to play aggressively if you think you're cornered. That said, my movements last turn ought to indicate that you're not cornered, so I am hoping we can return to normal relations. I am interested in the current FER alliance to counter AT and would prefer it survives.",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] england to russia: Actually, I just looked at the map again. You can keep Nor for now.",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] england to russia: I'd rather you fight AT in the East rn, and it looks like you do need every single center you can get. I'll keep denmark but Nor is yours.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] russia to england: Wow,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] russia to england: That’s really nice,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] russia to england: Thank you!! 😊,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] england to russia: Np. Go show those silly south-eastern nations who's boss lmao,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] russia to england: I love the spirit!,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to england: Is it ok with you if I move into Scandinavia>,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] england to russia: What tile specifically?,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to england: Lol. I meant SKA,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to england: I really hope you don't stab me. It would probably mean the end of both our nations.,0
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to england: Nevermind. I won't move into Ska. Wouldn't be a good move anyways. Ideally I would move into Nth and you would move NTH to helgoland, where we could both attack Germany but I realize that you might not trust me enough to do that.",1

"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Hey just replying to your message on backstabbr, happy to work together. So will you go to gal and ukr? I think we should still bounce in the black sea as it won't be great to make it obvious that we are working together...",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Hi Turkey! I would love to have a good relationship between our two great countries! Are you up for blitzing Austria? Looking forwards to a great game with you! 
-Russia",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: I think we should leave the Black Sea as a DMZ, as I would like to 100% ensure I get Rum and I'm worried about Austria taking it. So if we can agree to leave it as a DMZ I can move my fleet to rum",0
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Hmm ok that sounds fine,makes sense. As long as you're willing to help me take bud within the next couple of years and I'll return the favour for vie. What's your read on Italy in all of this?",0
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: He says that he and Austria have reached a truce for tyr,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: Hey so I ended up going to the black sea defensively because of all the info I was getting from Austria that you were planning to attack me. Not sure whether you actually are or whether you had the same sort of information from them that I was planning against you. I'm hoping its the latter as we have a great opportunity to carve up Austria given their very passive start. They should only get one build so they will be behind.,0
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Austria was telling me that you were going to attack me,0
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Wait what?!?!,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Austria is telling you imma attack you?,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: I agree w/ the great opportunity to get them,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: Alright, well that just isn't true. I guess they want to try and keep us from becoming allies. How about this - you take Rum with support and I take the Black Sea. I get BLA for insurance and you get Rum which gives you an extra build. I will try for Greece and might get it then we will be set up to attack Austria",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: To be honest, I don't really want you to have BLA. I'm just not there yet (although probably will be eventually). So what if I move to rum supporting myself, and you can attempt to trick Austria to support you into gre.",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: The ideal would be if I moved into Gal this turn, which would put tremendous pressure on Austria. But this would only work if my fleet moved too Rum, and you supported it.",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: If your working with Austria and betraying me I swear...,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Your basically for sure my ally now. Early in the game I was debating an alliance with Austria, but they seem to be spreading a lot of misinformation, and are asking for very unreasonable things. I think they still think I'm allied with them, so maybe I could persuade them not to move into rum and then you wouldn't even have to support me? If that worked it would be amazing as we would each get a build (I would actually get two).",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: I'm spreading some rumors about me being allied with Austria, hoping the news get back to them so don't be alarmed if somebody says something about that to u",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: OK I understand your hesitancy over BLA. Yes, Austria is spreading a lot of misinformation, to Italy as well as us. There are three things here and I can only give up one otherwise I'm putting myself under way too much risk. Its either 1) you taking RUM by yourself and I wont try and stop it 2) black sea DMZ (but we'd need to bounce it) 3) me supporting you into Rum. Whichever one you take, I can't give up any of the others. I would be too far onto the back foot with you getting a freebe in the North and Austria seemingly coming for me. 1902 will be a big year and if we work this out and we play it as allies then we can both have a lot of trust going into next year which will  be really valuable.",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: I would really like a lot of trust between us, as our alliance can be insanely powerful. I'm going to take Rum, and PLEASE don't stop me. But you don't need to support me either. I don't see why you would want BLA if not  too attack me?",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] russia to turkey: Oh man,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] russia to turkey: Well played Ig.,0
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] russia to turkey: 😭,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to russia: Ah very difficult to work out what was going to happen there after the first season. I knew I had to at least not give up the Black sea as that would be terrible for me. I had to protect it. It doesn't mean we have to be in all out war though. I just got too paranoid I guess.,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] russia to turkey: Mhm.,0

"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] russia to turkey: But I just can't believe that you were ""protecting yourself"" by moving to the black see. And as for your message before, 1 and 2 are just normal things that we would do in an alliance, those don't harm you at all."" 1) you taking RUM by yourself and I wont try and stop it 2) black sea DMZ (but we'd need to bounce it) 3) me supporting you into Rum. """,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: ok. So how about I won't attack you in Rum, if you don't attack me in gal. does that sound fair?",0
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: That sounds fair to me.,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: Oh it seems I didn't send that message off. I guess that's why you went ahead and attacked me in rum,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: I think a move into Eas could have a lot of potential.,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: For me?,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Oops. I meant Greece. So ig ur going to attack me in Sev. Last chance to crush Austria?,0
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: Ok yes let's do it. I think they are after me anyway,0
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: I'll support you into bud,0
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Great. I will support you into Sur next turn then,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: lol turkey,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: I did not have enough time to change my orders. Plus I didn't know which army to support... We needed more time.,0
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Ok. Try again next turn,0
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: I think I will move Moscow into War, with Sil supporting, where I could go for Austria the following turn.",0
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Also I will move Ukraine to gal. Could you support me there?,0
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: This is where we need to trust each other. I will be leaving Mos undefended and I need you not to stab me,0
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: Sorry, got all this way too late. I really have no idea whether you're actually willing to work with me or not at this point but I am open to ideas.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: I would like to work with you. I realize that you and Austria have an alliance against me, but so far you guys haven't done that much(although I will admit you have me anoyed 😤). Right now, you could lie to me, tell Austria your plans, and stab me, but I think that the better option for both of us is to work together against Austria. It seems like they totally trust you, and have left many territories undefended. Currently me and Italy have an alliance, and together the 3 of us could rip through Austrias territory, as they aren't expecting it",0
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: If you are up for this, I think the ideal attack would be:
Aeg - Gre
Ion s Aeg - Gre
Rum - Ser
Bul s Rum - Ser
Con - Bul
Sev - Rum",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: This would garuntee you two of Austria supply centers, unless Austria does something very weird.  I could support myself into Gal, and attempt to move for Vie.",0
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: So, what do you think? Up for leaving you Austrian ally behind and siding with me? Our alliance, if it works, could be a monumental one",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: You still around?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: Im up for this if you can confirm - so you want to take back Sev though right?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: And is Italy on board?,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Italy is on board.,0
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: I would like to have sev back, yes. I would be willing to give you support sometime in a future turn if you let me have sev back.",0
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: I would almost think that you are controlling Austria and turkey,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Your absolutely ridiculous.,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: You have such a good chance to stab Austria, and your practically doing nothing against me.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: And I think I have lost count of how many times you have stabbed me,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: I was honestly ready this time. I thought we had more time. I needed more time to sort it out with Italy. I see they didn't support me so luckily I didn't get the moves changed.,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Mhm,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: You’ve only said that, oh, how many times?",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: If I don't hear from you, then lets leave this until next year. I need confirmation otherwise its too risky.",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: I told you I needed confirmation otherwise it was too risky. I didn't get confirmation from Italy and there you go, too risky wouldn't have worked.",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: And you tell me Italy is on board and next minute they are asking me to support them into Greece,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Ok fine. You didn't really do any damage to me anyways,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: But now we have the whole weekend to work this out.,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: And ultimatly, I don't really care anymore what you do'",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: but if you attack me again I won't be up for negation anymore,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: OK but I can't give up SEV, not yet anyway. Way too dangerous. Move into GAL and I'll support you into BUD in the fall",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: You're funny. Why is giving up Sev ""way too dangerous? It's not like me having it gives me access to very much of your territory... it is Russian territory after all. You are already a very powerful country, and if you do as I suggest, moving into Gre and Serbia, you could have nine supply centers. If you give me Sev, I will support you into Bud",0
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: So I think the ideal would be something like:
Ion - Gre
Aeg s Ion - Gre
Rum - Ser
Bul s Rum - ser
Sev - Rum",0
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: Sev is too dangerous because Sev to Arm together with your ally Italy by sea and its basically and I just lost Austria as an ally. In the short-term then you have 3 to attack RUM with. Also, you think I can hold off you, Italy and Austria at the same time? I don't, not without SEV and not after giving up the ION as you're suggesting. Also, why would I be giving up ION in this scenario anyway if not to allow your ally Italy to come back at me by sea. And I don't know where you get 9 from? 6 + 2 - 1 = 7 then you're really going to support me into RUM in the fall *as well* as the 2 I got from Austria? So you get 1 and I get 3, that's really the deal you're happy with? Still totals to 8 by the way but we both know you have no intention of supporting me into RUM in the Fall. You will be attacking RUM with 3 while Italy tries to push through by sea. It doesn't take a genius to see that. Next time try and suggest a deal that actually has some appearance of sincerity otherwise it's just too easy to see through.",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Well... that was harsh. Let me just put a few things straight. Me and Italy is not a thing. I communicated with them the first year about a potential mid game alliance, as I didn't want to be the only one fighting you and Austria. But if you look at their moves, we haven't really done any work together. We haven't even communicated in years. If you look at what they have done so far, you'll see that they are a.) a very bad player or/and b.) are not at all committed to the game. They have basically communicated with nobody, haven't really attacked anyone, and had a good amount of invalid orders. At this point it doesn't make any sense for me to communicate with Italy, since they are a bad player and are going downhill fast. An alliance with you would be much better.",0
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: If what you say about you and Austria not having an alliance anymore is true, then it looks like you don't have any friends at all close to you. And I know you're feeling very strong right now, but you will lose all of that if you don't have a powerful alliance. We are both strong countries, and a war would basically mean both of us getting put out of the game",0
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: For the record, I don't think you can hold off me, Austria, and Italy at the same time. Definitely not. And although I have no interest in an alliance with Austria, they will be my second option if you continue to be this bellicose.",0
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Also can you read? I never suggested Sev to Arm, nor did I ever say I would support you into Rum. Make sure you get the facts straight before you go on a rant like that.",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: And one last thing. If everything happened like I said we should do it, you would have 8; 6 + 1(serbia) + 1(greece) + 1(bulgaria) -1(sev). But that doesn't mean I only get one. Have you noticed my units in Munich and Silesia by any chance? I think you were overreacting.",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: So, I'm still up for an alliance. I think it would be in both of our best interests, and could be very powerful"" But you need to stop constantly saying shit like""oh we never really worked it out"" or ""oh, I'm sorry it was too close to the adjudication period"", and then completely running over my ideas as soon as I say them. Sure, they weren't 100% ideal, or truthful. But we can talk, and work out the kinks instead of you going on this rant about how bad and unrealistic the plans are.",0
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: I know you didn't say anything about sev to arm, that's your army I'm talking about having the potential to move there but more likely you just attack rum. And yeah I meant your offer to support me into bud not rum. That's what you said you would do but I can't beleive you would do that so don't include  it in the offer.",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: ok, probably true",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: But you can't know that lol,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: So ummm.... do you want to try to make something worK?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Sure,1

[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: I'll back off and attack Italy and you attack austria,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Can't give up sev though but you'll probably be able to take it anyway.,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Lol actually I was thinking ""watch me you and get burnt""",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Great minds think allike I gues,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: So what are our short term plans? I still strongly think you should take Serbia,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Also, just letting you know, I'm telling austria that I'm going to attack you and that I want to make an alliance to attack you, just thought I would let you know. Ofc it isn't true, I'm just trying ot get them to move where I want",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: I'll just support myself in sev and rum which means you can take gal,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Army StP? Good luck with that one 🙂 We had a chance vs France but you and Austria don't. I'll have the black sea this year and i'll be the Turkish Turtle for the rest of the game 👍,1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: LOL. Some of you're own medicine turkey. I just can't believe how many times you said you would do something and then you didn't... Why would me and you have a better chance against france than me and austria?  And havn't you noticed my alliance... Well, good luck turkey. I can't see us doing anything together for the rest of the game if I'm going to be completely honest.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Did you see my moves last season? They were exactly as I said. Thanks though, good luck to you too. You've got a good chance now to win! 😃",1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Ok, now that I look at the moves again ig u didn't do anything you didn't say you would. But you didn't do anything that would benifit us, lke going for serbia or gre. Whatever, doesn't matter now. And who knows, if a miricle happened you could turn this game around and win it too!",1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Hey, france is getting huge. I'm not suggesting an alliance as it appears nothing works against us, but maybe we could set some of our disputes to allow us to focus our energy on trying to prevent france from winning?",1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: If you give me berlin back, I can support you into edi",0
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: I will happily do everything in my power to get you Berlin back :),1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: WOW. I couldn't tell you how much that means to me!,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: Lol but I would like to prevent France from winning. Can't do much though from where I am.,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Yeh. taking med tho,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Would b good,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: Would be great if I could. I agree.,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: I think you will be able to. U have 4 fleets and france only has 3,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: I will do my best,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Gl,1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Realistically, nobody is going to be able to win before 1910, except maybe france has a tiny chance? Anyways, I know that we mutually have absolutly no trust for eachother but I think the most strategic  option right now is to put our differences aside and elliminate austria + england and go for the 3 way win",1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Remember, the game is hardcapped 1910",1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: So france has shown a lot of interest with me trying to get me u and them to go for the 3 way, which I think is a good idea... but if u do want to go for it we will have to be on the lookout because there is a good chance france is lieng and is going to try to go for the solo",0
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: France is on 15. They have won this game easily. He only needs three more. He could even do it this year. Nap, Lon at least. Get an army into the UK and next year will be done very easily. He was also telling me the same thing but if he doesn't go for the win he's crazy. I'll lock in 3 way draw no problem but this game will be over next year with a French win no matter what we do.",1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: eh,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: If austria works with me we can basically take a center from france this turn,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: I think we might be able to do,0
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: it,0
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: No other options, really,",0
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: SO I say we keep talking to france about plans for our 3-way, but then work out something with austria and go against our word to try to draw it",1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: There arn't really any other options,0
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Sure, happy to do whatever. Throw everything at France because, really, its our duty not to just give in. Die fighting. Can you support Ser into Tri? I wont make any play for Sev. I should have built another fleet. That was dumb.",1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Or get him to support you into tri. I wont cut any. Then you can give him Vie back. 1 for 1. I'll just lose Nap and keep that fleet in Apu to help vs Ven.,1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: yeh, just wainting on a message from austria so we can coordinate",1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Alright, let me know what you want me to do - I'm just locking in Gre to Alb to help with Tri in the Fall if needed. Holding everywhere else.",1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: shouldn't we eliminate austria? This wouldn't harm us; in fact we would get our troops up there to fight france, and it would be a 3 or 4 way win instead of a 4 or 5 way w",1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: let me know if i'm wrong,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: this is just me thinking how to stop france,0
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: ?,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Hellooo?,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: I don't think so. Better with all of us vs France. But wither way France wins so whatever you like.,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: K,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Austria isn’t responding which is rly a problem,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: I'll support gal into bud then,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Let me know if that's cool,1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Ok. Put that in your orders. But if I get a message from Austria saying they want me to support them to try I won’t move into bud, so be prepared for a last-minute message",1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: It reallys sucks we didn't get a hand on austria... with them we definitly could have taken tri,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: U know what,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: lets let them have tri this spring,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: its still the spring,1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: so u take serbia from them, and I support myself into bud",1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: that way it wont seem like im betrahing france, and we are ready to take tri next turn",1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Is taht good?,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Oh god were running close to the deadline,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Btw if u betray me I will just be baffled at how self interested you are,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: NOt that I think u will,1

[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: do u like the plan?,1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Sure, would be good to be in tri in the spring though so we can put pressure on ven but stick to that. Destroy Austria.",1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: Hmm you didn't move out of Bla and against france? Ig I understand why u completly dont trust me but I feel that was a poor decision,1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to russia: Do you seriously think it would make any difference at all? I'm honestly asking. This game has been over for 2 seasons at least. It doesn't matter what we do now. Do you see the freebies in England? Who might be able to take those? Its first to 18 and France is on 15. Good on you for fighting to the end, but this game is over!",1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to turkey: eh,1

This garuntees us Tri, and prevents france from getting any centers. I think these are basically the best possible thing we could do in this situation. Please don't give up. Give it your all till the very end",1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: No problem. Will check those and enter them later today.,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: k great,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to russia: Ahh you have Bud S Alb to Tri but I think I'm taking Tri with Ser? I think Ser is best so support that in there?,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: Ok I’ll support that,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: That’s what I meant the whole time but typo my bad,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to turkey: But yeah do everything as the above except for bud supporting ser to tri,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I'd love to work with you this game- not sure what your thoughts are, but in my opinion Russia and France are the two countries who are the most natural allies on the board",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Hi France! I completely agree with you - Russia and France really are great allies. For now we might not have to much to do with eachother, but I would love to have an alliance with you! How is it looking in the north? Are you thinking of teaming up with England or germany? I would recommend england as an ally, as I have heard rumours of germany trying to takey you out. Looking forwards to a great game!

-Russia",0
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Sounds great! I took your advice and am working things out with England. Hopefully we can keep things balanced between them and meet up somewhere in the middle.,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Them being England and Germany,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Any thoughts on your south? A Russia/Turkey alliance could work well since I think that Austria and Italy may be fighting early on.,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Hmm. Do you know any more info about that?,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Unfortunately not, Turkey has been unwilling to share their plans",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Hmm. Are you still allied with England? They did a pretty anti - Russian move there.,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: I think England's moves might actually lean more pro Russia given that the army move failed and England will have to put a fleet in Norway. An army in Norway would be a lot more anti-Russian for sure.,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: That being said I am trying to see if England would be interested in making some anti-German moves which can help get England off of your back,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: What's the scoop regarding Turkey/Austria? Looks like everyone made relatively conservative openings,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: I'm with Austria. Going for turkey,0
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to russia: Umm. Well, that's not good",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] russia to france: Why is that?,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] russia to france: Obviously not anymore though,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to russia: It looks like Austria helped Turkey against you, and Turkey stabbed you",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] russia to france: I was actually allies with them both and was going to stab Austria but ig not,0
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] russia to france: Yeah,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to russia: I wonder if attacking Turkey with Austria is still on the table given Italy's position to help with Bulgaria and/or Rumania. Italy has a highly vested interest in seeing you do well too.,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Have you and England talked at all about taking Denmark from Germany?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Turkey's builds are looking pretty good for you,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Hopefully you both made up?,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: I'm not sure if me and turkey are allies anymore... If you want, you could clear the order with turkey, and move munich into Tyr, where you could help take Austria out.",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Sure, if I have a retreat I definitely plan to move there",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: By the way I've been spreading misinformation by saying that you will move to Silesia (just thought I'd give you a heads up),1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Darn, it looks like Turkey is really committed to attacking you which is too bad. Is Austria willing to work with you? This might be the best chance you both have of taking Rumania so I've strongly suggested to Austria that they support Galicia to Rumania.

I figure that cutting Rumania support is the best chance you have of keeping Sev, though Turkey has it guaranteed if they simply cut Ukraine support.",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: By the way, what are your thoughts regarding what you plan to do with Sweden?",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Are you willing to work with Austria?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: You there still?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Do you have information on German or English plans? Some Intel would really help at this point,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Hi france. I just got back from a long weekend, but now I will always be here ☺️. England wants me to attack Germany in Denmark, and said that you had requested that. Is that true? No idea about Germany as they are not responing",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Italy seems like they are messing up a lot. They had 3 invalid orders, so I don't know how strong of an ally they might be",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: What about you? Got any intel?,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: I would love to work together with Austria, as I think it would be a very powerful alliance. But I fear I can't stop turkey and Austria from continuing to attack me. Also I'm a little worried about England 😰.",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Hmm. I was under the impression that England would attack Denmark and that he wanted you to support him into Denmark.,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Yes. But did you request that?,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Sorry mistyped above. I meant England moving into denmark.,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Well, I assumed England would do it anyway because it should be a guaranteed supply center. England and I have been talking a lot",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: I think if you move to Norway you'll be better off, I didn't ask England to get you to support him I don't think but I did ask England to move to Denmark (otherwise I'd worry what else those fleets are up to)",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Yes. Me and England are on pretty good terms as well, but I really hope they don't attack me. What do you think the likelihood of that is? I think later in the game an alliance between me, you, and England could be insanly powerful.",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: My hope is that England supports himself into Denmark,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: True,0
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: True,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Hmm. It's honestly really tough to read England. I don't think they are going after you but they did mention taking Sweden earlier int he game so I might request a bounce in Norway or something like that,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: So you think I should move to nwy? And do you think I should arrange a bounce or use it to stab. I don't really want to attack England,0
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Hmm. If you don't really want to attack England I would arrange a bounce probably. I don't know what Norwegian Sea is up to but it is probably best if it stays there,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: There isn't a ton of time before the deadline so I'm not sure if England is online or not,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: I told England to move from nwg to Edinburgh and they agreed in return for me support a move to denmark,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: How close are you with England?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Sweet. That works fine as long as England follows through,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Also rn I don't have any things I need w/ Warsaw. Anywhere you would like me to move it?,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: I feel like if everything works out our alliance could last a long time and has potential to become very powerful.,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: I don't actually think I'm that close to England right now, but we talk a lot. He's said he will help me against Germany and I am somewhat skeptical of whether he will follow through or not",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: I don't thing Germany has many friends 💀,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: If I move to Silesia with war, I could help you w/ germany",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: I'd love to see that honestly,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Alright. Hopefully in return for support I could have Berlin and you would get the rest of Germany?,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Especially if the three of us work things out, you could drop down to the Baltic Sea and we'd be able to split Germany very quickly",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: That sounds good to me,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Right. But things might not work out that great if I move into Nwy.,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Haha,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: I'm kinda worried about attacking England, since that would mean England, Austria, and turkey all going after me and I don't think I can handle that.",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Yeah,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: I need to go, but I'll be back in 10  min if you wana keep talking 😁",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Sounds good,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Here's a thought. If we're taking down Germany, it would make sense for you to support England to Denmark",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: And then England moves North Sea to Helgoland, Norwegian Sea to North Sea, and Skaggerak to Denmark",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Unfortunately it seems that England is not online,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Do you know which unit England wanted to move to Denmark with?,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Yea I don't want to attack England. I think I will support instead.,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Perfect. I agree with your decision. After a brief convo with England I'm a lot less concerned about things because enow the stories are all matching up,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Soo... you did just talk to England, correct. Cuz I just messaged them and they are for sure online",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Yep I did talk to them. I think they were having connection issues earlier which is why I thought they were offline,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: they say they are bouncing North Sea in EC,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Checks out. We organized a bounce rhere,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Wait by EC do you mean the English Channel?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Yep,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Sorry about me moving into Norway. I was pretty worried they would attack me and some things didn’t match up. Also I really needed the build. Now I feel bad cuz they we’re completely honest 😭. Hopefully England will accept my apology and we can continue our alliance?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Honestly the build was worth it I think. Asutria and Turkey are seriously strong together and stopping them will be a lot harder than I first thought,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Yes. Thx for understanding.,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Turkey is crazy. They try to make a deal with me and they betray every time. Austria won’t respond to my messages. And basically nobody can help me over there. So hopefully I will be able to hold them off and get some extra builds from Germany,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: I wish Italy was a better player then they could help,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Anyways I need to go to bed now but talk in the morning,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Omfg turkey is ridiculous.,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: They just said “ i did not have enough time to change my orders. Alliance still on”,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Imma play gullible and just go with it 😂,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: God,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Sorry for the all the messages,0
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Yeah they are def lying lol 😂,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] france to russia: Building Warsaw and Moscow I'm assuming?,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] france to russia: Oh crap, you retreated to Bohemia?",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] france to russia: As much as I love to see you in Bohemia, I worry you won't be able todefend your Homeland effectively",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] france to russia: Do you have relations with either rturkey or Austria?,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] france to russia: What's the deal with Norway?,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] russia to france: England says the alliance might work if I move out of nwy, which I probably will, since I can't have another enemy. Turkey thinks I am very gullible, and keeps saying we will attack Austria, but he is 100% lying. Austria won't respond to my press. I messed up with that retreat. Imma build in Moscow",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] russia to france: Damn,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] russia to france: They r letting me keep NWY,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Winter] russia to france: Let’s hope It’s not a stab, but I don’t think it is",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: We should coordinate orders. I think Germany plans to take Burgundy so I am currently defending it and imagine any supports it gives will be cut.,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Can Bohemia head to Munich to cut Munich support though? I want to get clever and see if I can get away with this move but it relies on Munich's support being cut.,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Also do you have any reads on England? I could move into Ska but only if I'm sure they won't attack,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Sure. Do you want me to go as for as to support my move into Munich, or do you think Sil should head back to War instead?",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Oops. Not SKA. Nvm,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: HellO?,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Hey,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Not a good read on England right now. But he told me he wouldn't attack you if that helps,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I would not move Silesia to Warsaw because you want to make sure Ukraine has a valid retreat option,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I don't think a supported move on Munich will work right now, but that's what I'd lean towards unless you want to do a tactical pull back with Moscow-Livonia Ukraine-Moscow and silesia-Warsaw",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Nah,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: silesia could also go to Galicia,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: To cut support and hopefully keep Ukraine,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: rn I'm having Moscow to sev,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: with Ukraine supporting,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: sil to gal,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: boh to mun,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Sounds pretty good,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: I'm pretending to be in an alliance with turkey and I told them I was moving out of Moscow into Warsaw, so hopefully they will take the bait and move there instead of to gal",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: True,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Here's a tentative plan for the fall:
Kiel-Berlin
Bohemia-Munich
Silesia S Bohemia-Munich
Burgundy-Ruhr
English Channel S Picardy-Belgium
Picardy-Belgium
Helgoland-Holland
North Sea S Helgoland-Holland",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: This guarantees you Munich (unless something weird like Austria moves Galicia to Silesia??).,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: It guarantees England Holland and guarantees me Belgium. And England already has Kiel.,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Basically, Germany loses 4 dots in one turb",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: And if Ukraine goes to Warsaw, I think you'll be well defended and can build (since you are picking up munich) in St Petersburg. This way, you'll be able to defend Warsaw and Moscow too",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Thoughts? There may be room for refinements.,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Sorry, gtg to bed. Talk in morning",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Any new thoughts so we don't run too close to the deadline again 😅,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Yeh I agree. I like your plan.,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: And Ig mos would just move to sev?,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: bwahahahaha,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: I'm trying to get turkey to work with me. If they actually do that would be AMAZING as first we could crush Austria and then I could stab them,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Moscow to Sev makes sense,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: It would be great if Turkey did that! Though I worry Turkey might not go for that as my communication this year with him made it seem like Turkey was not interested in stabbing Austria.,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: I sent England the orders u sent me btw,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: yea. All they have done this game is stab me, so I would be suprised if they actually did't lie this time.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: I feel like turkey might be on board... we’ll see soon. If he is, Austria will lose two supply centers. If he’s not, I should be ok",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Nice!!! Had we known about the German NMR, we could have eliminated him this turn. That being said, this is still good.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: What are you thinking for builds? It depends on how you feel about England, but if you can trust them then A Warsaw would make sense",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Rn I'm just laughing  at Austria and turkey,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Turkey had such a good chance to stab Austria, he could have gotten two of their territories and put them out of the game, but instead he continues his war with Austria against me and they can't even capture any territories 😂.",0
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Idk about England so far they have been completely honest but they just asked me if they could convoy one of their armies into Livonia so they could help help defend my centers but I don't think I trust them enough for that,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Yeah haha, I think you might even have the chance to retake Sebastopol next year at this rate",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: On second thought, you might need the unit in Livonia honestly. It looks like Austria is intent on taking Bohemia, supporting themselves to Silesia, to then cut Warsaw support to take Ukraine, and then take Moscow. It's a 3 season maneuver, but it honestly is what is going to happen.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: I just asked Turkey why he isn't stabbing Austria. He replied that he is playing to solo. So I guess his thought is that he'll keep Austria as a puppet for the entire game and hopefully eek out enough progress to then brutally stab Austria on the last turn.,0
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: With these kinds of players, you kind of have to just hunker down and form coalitions to fight against them... and honestly the only reason it is working is Italy is just letting them make so much progress in the Med.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: I am having trouble keeping in contact with Italy, but what I want to do is work with him closely in the Med and put up a lot of fleet pressure in the south.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: If you can get in touch with Italy, it would be awesome to try and convince him to help with that",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: k,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: We should start planning our moves,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Also what are you thinking for the future of our alliance?,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: For sure. It does depend a little bit on English builds, but I honestly think that for the short term future we should be applying pressure on Austria and Turkey until they are forced to fight each-other.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: On my side, I'll be trying to work with Italy. If Italy remains uncooperative, I may have to move to attack them.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: What are your thoughts though?,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I am pretty confident that Austria will support Bohemia to Silesia. For that reason, I recommend:
Warsaw S Silesia H 
Munich-Berlin
Kiel S Munich-Berlin
Burgundy-Munich",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I'll send this to England as well,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Thoughts?,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: The safest way would be something like this:
Warsaw S Ukraine
Moscow S Ukraine
Munich S Silesia",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: New thought:
Ukraine-Sevastopol
Moscow S Ukraine-Sevastopol
Warsaw-Galicia
Silesia S Warsaw-Galicia
Munich-Berlin
Kiel S Munich-Berlin
Burgundy-Munich

This move set has all of the advantages of both move sets",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Ok, I'm here now. I know I have said this every time, but I think I might have something with turkey",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: We are working stuff out rn. They said they arn't in an alliance with austria anymore which, based off last turns moves, is totally plausible.",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Also, what do you think about turkey? If you have looked at their moves throughout this games and their alliances (basically none) it seems evident that either they arn't very committed to the game, or they are just bad at it. I have communicated with them a few times, but they don't really seem interested in talking.",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: I like you're moves. Although would Burgundy to munich be permanant? Or just moving through?,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Also I think you should go to war with Italy. They are weak, play bad, and are getting closed in on from all sides(if you attack them). Try not to let turkey get all their territories and become to strong 😅",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I was thinking that, I am waiting for replies from Italy and England first though.",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: ok,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Think I should try to play austria and turkey against eachother for Rum so I am garunteed to get it (if austria attacks)?,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I am looking to get another build soon to get another fleet on Italy, so as long as you were taking Berlin, and it looks like you aren't in immediate trouble, it would make sense to make the trade as I feel it is a bit more natural. But it's a bit to early to definitively say",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: If you can get them to fight that would be ideal, but I am 99% sure Turkey is lying",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: how so?,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I'm paraphrasing, but Turkey told me he was not going to attack Austria because he wants to eliminate you first",0
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: oof,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: ok,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: So is England on board w/ Munich to Berlin?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Also did you see england's builds? Given their position they are most likely going to turn on one of us and recruit the other to help out pretty soon...,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: They don't really have anyone to attack but me or you,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Also I would really preffer you not move into Munich. There is a good chance I won't get Berlin anyways if england doesn't support,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I haven't heard back on the support to Berlin yet unfortunately so it might be best to operate on the assumption it will not happen for now,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I am currently not moving to Munich, but let me know if England talks to you",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Ok,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Heard anything from England?,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: You're right, they probably intend to attack one of us. The builds make it ambiguous to who they plan to fight.",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: If they do, should we work together too take them out? The builds of only troops imply a convoy, so I think it would wipe most of their opportunities if we took out NTH... but then again, they might not attack us",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I can support Norway to North Sea,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: But I agree with your analysis that they want to convoy out, so taking North Sea would definitely slow them down a lot",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: So do you want me to move to the North Sea? They are saying that they are going to convoy to Italy but that seems implausible...,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Up to you, I'm happy to hold",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Ok sure, let’s wait one more turn. So for England has been true to their word, so..",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Sounds good,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Nice job getting Austria to turn on Turkey!,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: So, just by the board position we have two options.
1. Take Holland and North Sea from England this turn. I would bounce Italy out of Munich and you would get a build, presumably a fleet in St Petersburg.
2. We don't attack England since he's been a very reliable ally, and commit fully to the attack on Italy and Turkey. This would look like sending all of my fleets south, so it would mean losing the option to efficiently attack England later, and also potentially leave us open to being stabbed by England.",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Any thoughts or suggestions?,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Regarding the Austrian retreat from Galicia, I think it makes sense to retreat to Ukraine and take Rumania from Ukraine. That way, Turkey won't be able to retreat Rumania to Ukraine.",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I sent this to Austria as a recommendation and thought I'd share with you too:
Ukraine-Rumania
Moscow S Sevastopol H
Budapest S Serbia H
Serbia S Ukraine-Rumania
Galicia S Ukraine-Rumania",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Silesia-Warsaw is necessary as well I think in case Austria stabs you,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: I don't really want to turn on England... but we could,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: They told me you told them you didn't want to convoy their troops, and they said they didn't know what to do with them",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: So what are we doing about munich,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: ??,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: France... I need a response to get my orders in. If you see this in time please move one(w/o) support unit to Munich. Then you might bounce Italy but you might get it which would be ok to ig,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Sorry for the late response,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: I was thinking that in order for my armies to be useful, I inevitably need to be moving through Munich to get to Tyrolia and other key territories anyway, so it seems more natural to me to have Munich and for you to have Berlin. There is also the fact that I kind of need a build right now, so if we are not attacking England I would like to have Munich as you are already picking up Berlin and Sevastopol.",1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Winter] france to russia: Awesome- looks like you have one supply center open for building in St Petersburg and one build, which works out perfectly.",1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Winter] france to russia: We need to get you a build this year so you can put a fleet in Sevastopol,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Winter] russia to france: Wow you got lucky... got one of my territories and two of Italy’s...,1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Winter] russia to france: If we’re going to abandon our English ally, I’ll build a fleet... but if not, prob an army",1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Winter] russia to france: So... England, or no?",1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Winter] france to russia: It's now or never, I say we should go for it",1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Winter] france to russia: I have to say though, I really like England as a player, so it's a lot tougher of a call than I'm letting on.",1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Winter] france to russia: I think though that you could get away with building an army and moving it to Finland, as to not set off any warning signs. Finland has a lot of advantages including the ability to defend both Sweden and Norway",1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Winter] france to russia: So I would probably build an army in St Petersburg even if you are on board with attacking England,0
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Winter] france to russia: I also do want to wait for builds since I actually might not be able to even attack England due to Italy, Austria, and Turkey hating my guts",0
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: How are things with Austria? Hearing anything interesting lately?,1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Intial thoughts:
Moscow-Sevastopol
Sevastopol-Ukraine
Galicia-Bohemia
Warsaw-Galicia

This achieves a strong position to corner Italy as well as potentially bounces with Armenia, allowing you to build F Sevastopol in the winter",1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Anti English:
Norway-North Sea
Berlin-Kiel
Munich S Berlin-Kiel
Ruhr-Holland
Belgium S Ruhr-Holland
English Channel S Norway-North Sea",1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: This accomplishes the goal of getting you a build in Kiel, and takes the North Sea, Holland, and Belgium all in one turn.",1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: If you'd like, we can probably wait to make this move in the fall so that England will immediately have to pull two units off the board for builds",1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: I'm up for doing it this turn. Or next. I will also move Stp to Finla d,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Sounds good- let's wait a turn then,1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Ok. I will still move to finland this turn ig. Hopefuly that doesn't send off any alarms to england, though it probably will. but I can say something like ""it doesn't really have anywhere else to go, and it's just for safety seeing as you attacked berlin last turn""... or something along those lines",1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: So, if I'm going to be completly honest here(something that doesn't often happen in this game 🙃), I'm a little bit worried about you getting a few more supply centres and running off with the game. You took Munich from me, and then also two of italys. Nine supply centres and a good position. A little bit disturbing, if you can understand. And no, this doens't mean I'm calling off our alliance, or teaming up with enland,(that would be stupid of me as they are completely stranded).  So we are both strong countries, and could probably get away with a two way win, but are you at all interested in that?",1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: True. If we do it right, a fall stab should be unpreventable even if England does suspect something.",1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I appreciate you bringing up concerns: I would definitely be interested in a two-way win. It might be comforting to know that the supply center gap is absolutely temporary as Italy and Austria will work together to push me out of both Rome and Naples (not to mention, the fact that it ties up 4-5 of my units just to the Italian front). That on top of getting you a build this year should even things out, if not put things in your favor.",0
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Yea. Too early to tell about a lot of this stuff. Here's to a good alliance🥂!,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: We should both keep talking to england; maybe suggest some orders that would make our attack more effective,1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: True. Just to be safe, it would be a good idea to dislodge the north Sea and prevent any convoys. It's going to mean England will know what's up, but I think our attack is unstoppable anyway. I think I can do this with just Belgium and English Channel",1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: It might be smart to move Norway-Sweden and St Petersburg-Norway in order to try and make a play for Denmark too next year,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Oh man I wish I could have seen that in time so we could have coordinated...,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Oh well,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: No worries,1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: I am supporting Berlin to Kiel so absolutely make sure Sevastopol is open for a fleet build (probably Moscow-Sevastopol and Ukraine-Sevastopol). Also try not to let Turkey find out, because otherwise he might try to support you into Sev",1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Any thoughts on what you want to do with Norway?,1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Ok sounds good. Nwy will move to Ska maybe to take denmark, since you are already big and it wouldn't really make sense for you to have it after this turn(so take it this turn and I'll take it back and support u somewhere else instead) if thats ok with yo",1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Sounds good regarding moving to Skag. We can definitely organize a way to split up English supply centers, though I am a bit cautious of doing it now since I expect to be losing supply centers in the short term (to Austria).",1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Winter] france to russia: So you moved to the North Sea. What gives?,1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Winter] russia to france: Yeah last minute I decided that was a better position, since one of us should probalby occupy it, and it also has access to denmark. I hope that's ok and doesn't come accross as agressive. I will totally move out of there next turn if u ask me too, since you have more fleets that need to get out into the sea",1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Winter] russia to france: But I think that turn went amazing; I got rum from austria, and bounced in sev. Looks like you did pretty well too. I think if we continue this alliance, we could totally win",1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Winter] russia to france: I think I will go with an army in warsaw, instead of a fleet in Stp, since I broke off the relationship with austria, and england doesn't seem like a threat. IS that good with you or would you preffer me to build in Stp, to get Enland out of the game quickly?",1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Winter] france to russia: Cool- we might be better off with you in the North Sea actually since it opens up the option to convoy to the island next turn. It depends somewhat on English disbands. Warsaw is fine with me- I agree with your logic, and we probably have enough units for England anyway",1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Winter] russia to france: Great! Thanks mate,1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: You didn't build a fleet in Sevastopol?,1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: The weak point in England's defense is Edinburgh so we should try to find a way to take that,0
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Oh god I messed up.,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Forgot to build,1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: It happens sometimes. I think you still have a strong position in the south unless Turkey and Austria start working together again,1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Thoughts on sending north Sea to Norwegian Sea? I worry that a convoy is easily distrupted but Edinburgh is easy to take if we do that,1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Any ideas for Trieste?,1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: How is a convoy easily disrupted? You realize that one has to dislodge a unit in order to stop it from convoying. And france can't do that. Although Ig they could stay in edi, but moving to the norwegian wouldn't change anything about that",1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: If you're there we can plan our moves,1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: I can keep kiel and berlin, right? Since you got the rest of germany. So w/ my unit in kiel maybe i should go to denmark? Or i could do that with sweden",1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Triest could support me into venice?,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Do you want me to convoy one of you're units to edi?,1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Although me moving to venice is pretty risky, if austrai and turkey team up",1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: You could say something to austrai about an alliance to try to get them not too attack you,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: sorry for all the messages lol,1

[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Because England will move Wales to Yorkshire and thus there is no way to convoy to the island,1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: NTH-Norwegian Sea IMO so that I can move my fleet to the North Sea but everything else seems ok,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: ok. Any suggestions? So i'm assuming you will move to serbia?,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: W/ my fleet in nrth sea i will support you into england if you do me that favor,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: also ig kiel will just chill?,1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I think I have to defend Venice from Austria but I will try to get Austria to make some bad moves,1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I think it makes sense to hold in Kiel,1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Maybe move it back to Berlin or something,1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I could move to Serbia it just means I'll lose Venice and Trieste too and Edinburgh is unfortunately not guaranteed, so I think I'd have to keep Denmark in that scenario to avoid losing 3 supply centers in one turn",1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: That's not entirly fair... chances are you will loose either venice OR triest,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: And when im in viena i can help u into bud,0
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: So how about we go with what I said, and I don't take denmark this turn but I will take it next turn(or maybe not) depending on what u have for supply centrs",1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: idk what do u think would be best for both of us on the whole,1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: That works for me,0
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: k. I won't move to denmark this turn then,1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: I really hope you don't betray me as I think that would be bad for both of us in the long run and if we stick together we are basicaly garunteed a win at this point, but if we fight it could escalate and we would destroy eachother",0
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: lol,1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I agree- betraying at this point would be short-sighted. In many ways, you are better positioned to stab me than I am to stab you since I have so many units tied up in Italy, Austria, and Turkey.",0
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Well, i can't say I agree with the latter, but I agree with your first point 😘",1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: lol france,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: i sorta knew u would do that but I wanted to give u a chance,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: I have to be honest I’m pretty disappointed about that,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: 😭,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Ig I overestimated,1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I know what this looks like, and I think you should make whichever moves make you more comfortable, but I needed to find a way to convince Austria to work with me against Turkey in the fall and split them up, so as a condition I put in these moves. That being said, it's a spring move, and so my plan is to reverse the spring by walking back out of Kiel and Berlin",0
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: I have to say that the Austrian moves were an unexpected and great surprise, as it will be putting massive strains on Turkey and Austria working together in the long run.",0
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: If anything, you have a build in pocket, and are picking up Vienna and Budapest.  If I was going to stab you I would have chosen a different turn and told Austria about you moving to Vienna",0
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: LOL nice try France. If your going to try to persuade me that taking two of my centers isn't betraying me, then I don't know what too say. And why in the world would you need Austria to work with you against turkey? You're overrunning the map, and turkey is probably the least of your concern right now. If you didn't want this too be a betrayal, you could have told me and worked something out beforehand. And yes, I have a build(s) on my hand, but unless you actually do as you say, and move out of my centers, I won't really have a chance for winning. I could have gotten you in Denmark, and although I considered it I didn't.",0
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: But if you do want to work something out and move out of my centers that would be pretty nice ...😁,1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: I mean, you will definitely be in the draw if that's what you meant. I would have 100% proposed this beforehand, but I felt that the plan might be jeapordized if you weren't fully on board. I get that you feel like you have to move to defend yourself and in that sense it unfortunately makes sense for me to hold onto Kiel and Berlin since I expect to be losing 2 supply centers in the south, and it seems like you aren't interested in supporting North Sea to Edinburgh.",0
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Turkey is a cunning player and I fear that with the right tactical positioning Turkey would be able to conquer the Mediterranean，especially since I only have 3 fleets to his 4, and considering the superior defensive and offensive position of Turkey on the map in regards to naval power.",0
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: you keep saying your going to lose centers and you never do... your probably going to take munich...,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: You say you didn't stab me but you are bieng completly unreasonable in everything that you are saying.,1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: In this (not losing centers) I truly have been extraordinarily lucky, but it is bound to end at some point.",1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Well you can't know that.,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: So what do you want to do,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: 16 min to figure this out,1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: It's just highly unlikely, but I guess it is still theoretically possible for me to continue growing this turn. Next turn it is impossible as I will no longer be bordering any supply centers that I can possibly take",0
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: So i'm assuming you're going to take munich?,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: ANd your unwilling to give me berlin or kiel back?,1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: My pitch would be eliminating Italy, Austria, and England and going for a 3-way draw with Turkey since at this point we can't eliminate Turkey by 1910. Not sure what your relationship with Turkey is like?",0
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: I'm open to the possibility of giving back either and/or not taking Munich. I think it makes sense for me to keep them unless we can figure out a deal with Edinburgh,0
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Also england might be difficult to get down quickly unless we get builds as fleets and send them over there which kind of feels like a waste,1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: OH god, don't get me started on turkey. They are really hard to agree with. But that is the most likely outcome. Although if you get a few more centers from austria and stab me u will win.",1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: It's not likely when I'm still on 12, but yeah the other alternative is to keep either England or Austria alive and settle for a 4 way draw",1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: If you want me to trust you I think you should give at least one back, as you are much bigger and frankly it's probably in your best interest to go for the solo, although if the rest of the contries cooperate you almost certaintly won't get it. And your definitly going to need me if you want to go for the draw",0
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: But no lets not do 4 way,1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: |f your going to give me one back I think it would make most sense if I had berlin, but you would most likely move berlin to Pru or Sil which is scary even in the most trusting relationship",1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: That's fair. I agree, the difference between 3 way and 4 way is pretty significant.",1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: I think a three way is probably possible,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Should I message turkey,1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Sure,1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Do you know anything about Austria's moves?,1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Unless you give me back/let me keep one of them, I don't think I will agree to bieng your ally, and this game will probably end in a 5 way draw hard cap",1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: No idea about austria,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: So berlin will move to silesia,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: ?,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Ahh,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: 1 minute,1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: That's a reasonable position to take- I can give you one back for sure. Though maybe it makes more sense to support you to Edinburgh for a similar effect and not having me move to Silesia?,0
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: ok we have one min change ur orders,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: no time to work out something for edi,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: lol this is stressful,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: next time we need to work out something before this close to adjudication,1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Damn! I changed my orders but they didn't go through for some reason,0
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Shit,1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Yeah that was cutting it way to close,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: I don't know if I can believe you but now were fucked,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: this is really bad,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: lost rum,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: and didn't get bud,1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: That was extremely unlucky in the south, Turkey and Austria guessed completely correctly somehow",1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: ANd wow ur working with turkey?,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Ok I need to go],1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Tmrow maybe we can try to work out a 3 way draw,1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Hmm. More like the move mutually benefits us as it means he isn't in the Gulf of Lyons and also means Italy is eliminated,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: yeh ig,1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: Alright, we'll talk tomorrow for sure",1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: Alhtough tbh u might be able to get the solo,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] russia to france: If you go for it gl,1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Fall] france to russia: The south did go very lucky for me last turn, but I don't think the dots that I need are within reach for at least a couple years- thanks though lol",0
"[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:8] [SEASON:Winter] france to russia: So the *best way* to go for the 3 way draw right now would be for me to move North Sea to Yorkshire and move Skaggerak to North Sea while you convoyed an army from Norway into Clyde. This way, we can take both London and Edinburgh in the fall, and next year I would support you to Liverpool",0
[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:8] [SEASON:Winter] france to russia: In the south you can easily take Serbia and Budapest provided that you can actually work with Turket,1
"[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:8] [SEASON:Winter] france to russia: What are you thinking for builds? It would kind of make sense to build against England, but if you are worried about me expanding I would be ok with an army in Warsaw",1
"[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:8] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: We could convoy Norway to Clyde. Or, if you prefer, I can support Norwegian Sea to Edi",1
[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:8] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Did you work out a plan with Turkey?,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-8] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Ok i;m here,1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-8] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: messaged turkey, but they havn't responded yet",0
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-8] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Ok lets do a convoy into clyde,0
"[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:8] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Sorry, didn't get a chance to respond to this. I wish you did the convoy, since at least then you could have gotten Edinburgh.",1
[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:8] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Turkey made a large oversight in the 3-way draw plans by letting Austria survive and retreat to Greece,1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-8] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: I mean, I really didn't expect you to keep to your work",1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-8] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: It only made sense you would go for the solo,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-8] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Your probably going to win but I wont give up 😤,1
"[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:8] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: Fair enough. I made some lucky guesses in the south, but I'm pretty sure you have me stopped. I have a 3 way draw set, so it will really depend on how fast England gets eliminated.",0
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-8] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Idk... I think youll win. Only need 3 centers and u have like 3 yrs,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-8] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: Yea tbh u got insanely lucky,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-8] [SEASON:Spring] russia to france: and ur a good player,1
[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:8] [SEASON:Spring] france to russia: We'll see- my luck has to run out at some point ;). Interesting to see that Turkey still doesn't quite trust you as he stayed in the Black Sea instead of moving it to Constantinople and against me,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to turkey: Hello Turkey. I believe we could benefit from coordination as it relates to the East. Are you open to some level of dialogue on that issue?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to england: Hello! I am certainly open to this and welcome the opportunity. How goes diplomacy with your neighbours?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to turkey: Hello! That is wonderful. Diplomacy with my neighbors has been thus far lovely. How goes yours?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to england: All pretty civil if a little quiet at this point down in the corner here.,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to england: Well one thing I can tell you is that Russia is indicating that they are committing south. Thought you might be interested in that :),1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to turkey: Awesome thanks!,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to turkey: Hello Turkey! Thank you for what seems to be accurate intel! I am curious as to how you and Austria are getting along?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to england: Things are up in the air as far as I'm concerned! I don't know what they're up to. I think Russia has benefited most from the opening season. I would be concerned about letting them get too much up North,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: Hello France! Our fleets bordering the English Channel seem kind of awkward, but I'd like to maintain friendly relations with you. Can we agree to go our separate ways and leave EC free of fleets?",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: I agree, I think Scandinavia is too important for England to pass up on it. Also, France struggles to efficiently attack England since I only start with one fleet",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: I'll be around for more negotiation later today,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: Alright splendid. I will keep my fleet out of EC. Further details can be discussed later.,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: Perfect. Sounds great!,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: By the way, have you heard from Germany? They wanted me to attack you so I think they were trying to get us to fight eachother.",0
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: Yeah they were being weird earlier. I was talking about countering Russia in Scandinavia and they kept insisting that we needed to deal with you first.,0
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: I'm not sure what they hope to accomplish, but I suspect we're being played.",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: Given my communication with them they probably just want us to fight so that they can take Scandinavia/Belgium for themselves,0
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: Alright I'll see if i can sus out their plan,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: The Liverpool to London misorder hurts a bit, but otherwise it looks like you are in a good place",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: The moves indicate that Germany is going after 3 builds, but we could try to stop that from happening if you are on board?",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: I thought you could move into a space that was becoming vacant,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: ?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Why did that misorder happen>,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: And I'm talking to Germany to see if I can negotiate him down to 2 builds,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Liverpool doesn't border London,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: What are you doing with North Sea then? I was thinking that you could bounce him out of Denmark,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: lmao just glanced at the borders and went for it,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: oh I'm a fool,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: I'm not sure if I'm in the position to do that. Have you talked to Austria?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: I have talked with Austria,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: How did that go?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Pretty well,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Where are they looking to expand?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: I think they mostly just want to take neutral supply centers like Serbia for now,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Okay. I am leaning toward biding my time and grabbing Sweden later,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: I am not going to make enemies of a 3 build Germany, but I won't help them attack you rn",1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Even if they get bounced down to two, I'm harming my own interests",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: I'll move to Munich if you move to Denmark,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Deal.,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Sounds great,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Alright I'll be bouncing Denmark. Germany thinks we're going to form a loose 3-way alliance for a few turns,0
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: I had to justify not going NC somehow,0
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: EC**,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Cool. I'm headed to Munich- if these both work you will be in an especially strong position to start capitalizing on Germany's lack of fleet power.,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: What gives? I understand that you wanted to get Germany and I into a war without participating, but honestly what you risk at this point is me and Germany working things out and attacking you. Is there any reason that I should not just do that?",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: I don't want to fight you since I find it incredibly easy for both of us to defend against eachother.,0
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Winter] england to france: Hello and apologies. Considering that both of you are rather powerful with your early builds, I didn't want to overcommit to one side before I knew I could reasonably trust in my own safety. As such, I not move turn 1 EC against you, and I didn't move into Denmark.",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Winter] england to france: I realize that might be exceptionally frustrating, but hopefully you understand why I might be incredibly cautious with only one build.",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Winter] england to france: That said, I had a lot more to lose in this situation than you. Now that I know I can trust you in our efforts against Germany, I would be more than willing to use my navy to help your cause.",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: That's great to hear, but I need an actual commitment. I'd like to see you build fleet Edinburgh (or an army). I'd also really like to see English Channel move to the North Sea.",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: The problem is you lied last turn about bouncing Denmark when you could have told the truth. That's not a good look, whatever your reasons were.",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Winter] england to france: That's valid. I can understand why you'd hesitate to trust me. I will comply with the above requests, and we can decide what to do from there.",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: Thanks. As a heads up I do intend to build fleets, but if you follow through they can be used to attack Italy.",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Winter] england to france: Alrighty,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: Any knowledge of German orders/builds? What have they told you,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Winter] england to france: Nothing super interesting. They want me to go into Brest while they attack. I'll try to find out more for ya,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: Sounds great. Just as a heads up, Germany has been telling me that he would send his fleet in Holland to North Sea if I withdrew from Munich. Probably a lie, but thought I'd mention it.",0
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: I'm very close with Russia in terms of our relationship, and I just realized that you and Russia can take Denmark from Germany this turn. Is that something you are interested in? I would definitely ask Russia if they can support you into Denmark in the fall when you are in the North Sea",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: Also, any thoughts on how I might keep Munich? Just looking to get a second opinion on things.",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: Like if you falsely claim Russia wants to move west this turn,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: I shall talk to Russia, and I don't know how you'd keep Munich but perhaps some sort of deception regarding Russia's goals may work",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: Great idea! Yeah I'll try to see if that misinformation can be spread,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: Yeah I think Russia is moving to Silesia (wink, wink 😉)",0
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: Oh no! If only there were an army in Munich willing to help out!,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: I'm very happy to see your moves. Whild convoying London to Denmark is tempting, I think it makes the most sense to send Skaggerak to Denmark for two reasons.",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Firstly, Russia is the only thing preventing Turkey and Austria from rapid expansion, which is something we need to prevent in case either of them get in a dominant position in the east to the point of soloing, or being too big to take out in the future.",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Secondly, a fleet in Denmark can support a fleet from the North Sea into the Helgoland Blight, which is important in case Holland tries to bounce that move. Getting that fleet there is necessary if we hope to take Holland or Kiel in the future.",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: By the way, pretty much everything I've told Germany this turn is a lie. Just so you know",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Can you move your Brest fleet down south? I'd prefer not to leave my backdoor unlocked, and nothing I have will be able to capitalize on that. That said, I'll be moving into Denmark",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Are you comfortable if it goes to Picardy again? I want to try and corner Belgium.,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Germany is insisting that you told him that you'd attack me next, which is concerning since I am a logical target, and it's ""pretty much everything"" is a lie",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Depends.,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Look. You helped me out a ton last turn my moving out of the English Channel and building the fleet in Edinburgh. Meanwhile, Germany built 2 armies, used them against me to take a dot from me (I have a disband this turn), and tried to take Picardy. I'm not going to forget that.

I'm not going to attack you right now. And despite how difficult it is to predict the future in this game, I honestly don't see myself attacking you in the future either. Germany is the largest threat to me right now, and I can't overextend against you without worrying about Italy who has a fleet in Rome (which can only move West).",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Not to mention. You have a build coming and I have a disband. There's no chance I can win in a fight against you. Germany is trying to show discord between us because he knows it's the only chance he has to survive if we start working together. And for the record, I told him I'd be attacking you right now *if and only if* he gives me Belgium (this is a lie, but I'm hoping that I can snag Belgium this turn). I did not say anything about attacking you after splitting up Germany (and in general I like to deal with the present situation instead of making long-term plans, since the board is constantly changing).

I'll be around to talk more later today, but hopefully that assuaged some of your fears",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Okay. I will continue to support you against Germany. However, I will only accept Brest into Picardy if MAO moves south. You have other things to worry about, but I'm not going to open up my coasts without an insurance policy. I will move into Denmark, ideally with Russian support, and we can see how the situation progresses from there.",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: If you maintain our alliance for the duration of the conflict against Germany, I will surrender Belgium and Holland to you as well",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: I will 100% do that if that is what we want to do. I don't mean to push it too much (as I realize just Picardy is a large trust excersize), but in the interest of full disclosure, I was initially planning to send MAO to the English Channel. I wanted to put that on the table as a way to get 3 units on Belgium. If Germany plays his cards correctly there is a high chance I lose Ruhr, and that will make it hard to take Belgium. Again, I know it's a huge ask, so right now I'm sending MAO south unless you allow me to put it in the channel temporarily. If you do allow that, you would have control over what we do with that unit- whether that's convoying London to Belgium, cutting Belgium support to try and capture Holland, or sending it to Belgium with supports from Burgundy and Picardy.",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: I can see why you'd want MAO in EC. As a compromise, you can keep MAO where it is instead of moving south, and maybe EC next. Picardy and EC are two big bites, and being able to take them one at a time would go far in my comfort with that move.",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Sounds great! Thanks. Let me know if you find out anything about what Germany plans to do (I will do the same, but at this point I don't think he'd share any reliable info with me).",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Lol Germany is mad at me I don't think I'm gonna get much either,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: I can't imagine he is not telling you anything. He has to be telling you something.,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: If he's telling you that he will give you Denmark, he is lying. You need to support yourself to there",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: He offered me Belgium to turn on you thats it,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: He hasn't mentioned Denmark,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Interesting.,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Do you know what Russia is doing with Sweden?,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: I asked him to support me into Denmark, but he hasn't been replying so idk if he will",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Yeah it seems like most of the players are not replying, probably due to the labor day weekend.",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Yeah that makes sense.,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Germany thinks I'm going to turn on you for belgium.,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Is he giving you Belgium right now?,0
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Is he giving you Belgium right now?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: I don't think it's possible for him to give you Belgium unless he makes some wacky moves into the Helgoland Blight and to Holland,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: I don't think he is. He believes it'll be a long term exchange,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Are you online,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Are you online?,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: My connection kind of sucks but I'm here,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: What's up?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Russia was just saying he'd support you to Denmark,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: This changes a lot in terms of plans because one thing you can do now is move North Sea to Helgoland and Norwegian Sea to North Sea,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: He wants me to send Nor west so idk if that will fly with him.,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: You'd be able to conviy into Kiel or Holland next Spring and take the other in the fall for two dots,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Yeah he told me he wanted you to put it in Edinburgh,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: I'd be fine with that but it's a regressive move. If anything, Russia is just worried that you'll attack him",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Other option if you want to be safe is we can bounce in the English Channel,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: It's slower but we can do all this stuff next year anyway as long as you stay in North Sea,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: I'm glad since Russia's silence was really worrying me, but it seems like he was just away for the weekend",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Alright that sounds good to me. NWG will go to Edi, North Sea can bounce EC, and Ska will take Denmark.",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: And yeah I was worried too but all is well so that's comforting.,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Sounds good. Ordered and in,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: You may want to move London out of the way since your re going to have a build and I assume you don't want to build in liverpool,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: That's a marvelous point thanks for mentioning that.,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: So Russia,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: We probably should have seen that coming since zRussia does honestly really need the build to stop Turkey Austria from rolling over him,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Depending on what Russia says you should decide between spending effort to evict Russia from Norway or letting it go,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Russia said there was a discrepancy between what you're telling and him and what I told him. What did you communicate to him about my moves?,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: I just need to find out if he legitimately thought he was in danger or if he acted with malice.,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:2] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: We talked a lot and pretty fast, so there is a chance some things got lost in translation. But basically I just told him we were bouncing in the channel and we had worked things out",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-2] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Alright cool. He went to bed but I'm gonna figure out my move in the morning.,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: Any ideas on what you want your next steps to be? I don't think Russia stabbed you from malice. If anything I think we'll see with Russias builds that he does not want to get into conflict with you,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: If it is possible to work through this, we need to start working on attacking Germany ASAP. Right now it's a clusterfuck and Austria Turkey are going to roll over the West if we don't work together",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] england to france: Being deprived of a build really kills my momentum on fighting Germany.  One of my fleets will go into securing Norway, and i'll also try to move against Germany with one of my fleets",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] england to france: Edi will probably end up in the North Sea,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] england to france: Russia didn't like me having so many fleets near him but he stabbed me so he's gonna have to deal with it lol,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: If Edi will end up in the North Sea, where is North Sea headed? To Helgoland Blight?",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] england to france: NS will go Nor,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: Makes sense. I'm assuming you worked it out with Russia since otherwise it would probably bounce,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] england to france: He said he'd vacate Nor so here's hoping lol,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: You seem very hesitant to attack either Germany or me. You have to commit to one side at some point though, or else nobody will make any progress while Turkey starts decimating the East and soloes.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: I would highly recommend letting Russia keep Norway for now because he will need the units against Turkey, and you can always take Norway back later",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: Meanwhile, you have a really good opportunity to take some German centers",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: Idk it seems like you aren't worried about Turkey/Austria at all.,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: You should be very worried. Think about them as an 11 center power. They're going to roll over Italy and Russia very, very quickly",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: It seems like you are so far away, so you don't have to worry about it. But the truth is that they don't need a single one of your supply centers for one of them to win the game.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: As far as I can tell, Turkey is the stronger partner and Austria is mostly just going along with it. I've been trying for the past 2 years to get them to fight unsuccessfully, though you are welcome to try",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: If this pattern continues we will see Turkey stab Austria once the solo is in sight,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: It's so much easier to stop right now rather than later. Or in fact, instead of stopping it we could just create a stronger counter-alliance",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: That's why I want Russia to be as strong as possible right now to stop the AT in their tracks. If you don't want to do that I think we have to hit Germany hard right now. Maybe you can move to the Helgoland and take Norway in the fall?,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] england to france: While I reasonably hesitated to involve myself in the conflict with a Germany, the fact that I have taken Denmark (and intend to continue attacking with the fleet in Denmark) ought to indicate that I'm no longer hesitating to commit. While Turkey/Austria is a significant threat in the late game, I'm also concerned with not being eliminated in the short-term. The fact of the matter is that I am surrounded by powers who can stab me with devastating effect (you) or powers who have in fact stabbed me (Russia) or would stab if given the chance (Germany). I am more than willing to hit Germany right now and move South from Denmark, but I also need to cover my bases and get Nor. Russia can have centers in Germany to combat AT.",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] england to france: I'm willing to be the weaker power in the interest of countering AT, but I am inclined to think that holding Denmark and Nor is a very reasonable minimum.",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: Very fair, thanks for writing out your thoughts. We'll see what happens but you probably will grow faster than I can. Germany has so many armies that any successful attack on him hinges on you (and Russia to some extent)",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] england to france: Alright. Where do you want the Danish fleet to move? Has Russia communicated a plan with his armies? I'll communicate to Russia that if I have Norway he can take his picking of German centers to combat AT,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: Makes sense to move it to Kiel I think?,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: Yeah I was thinking actually that it would make sense to put Russia into munich,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: Russia disappeared again but hopefully we can work that out,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] england to france: Hey I just told Russia he can keep Nor for now.,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] england to france: I really don't want to have to deal with Turkey pushing up to StP or something,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: Awesome! Russia told me he would build an army in Moscow, so if he guesses right he might be able to keep Turkey out for now",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: Everything looks good right now. If you sill plan to let Russia keep Norway then I would recommend ordering North Sea-Helgoland Blight, Denmark - Kiel, and Edinburgh-North Sea. Best case scenario, you end up in Helgoland Blight, Kiel, and North Sea and can take Holland in the fall for a total of both Kiel and Holland",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: I recommend this because I believe that Germany trusts you and that he will not make an attempt to defend Kiel, especially if you tell him that you have your hands full with Russia and me.",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: I hate to ruin the party but there is no chance in hell that Germany trusts me. They have fully stopped replying to me.,1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: That said, I'm sure their hands are full anyway, so I'll move into Kiel",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: Oh haha. Well, he isn't talking to me either, so I guess he may have given up 😂",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: I need you tell me whether or not the idea I just had is stupid. If Russia trusts the FER alliance, I could totally convoy army to Livonia and support any of the centers neighboring it. Is that even worth proposing or should it stay in my head?",1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: Support Russia defending I mean.,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: It's worth proposing but maybe not at this point since it will take a while to set up anyway. That's a great idea for the future I think,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: What's your goal with EC?,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Literally just to take Belgium- after that it will go south or help you if needed,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Alright. I'm gonna trust that since conflict among FER is a bad look given AT,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Here's a tentative plan:
Kiel-Berlin
Bohemia-Munich
Silesia S Bohemia-Munich
Burgundy-Ruhr
English Channel S Picardy-Belgium
Picardy-Belgium
Helgoland-Holland
North Sea S Helgoland-Holland",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: You have almost nothing to worry about- you can cover London this turn and have a strong chance to get 2 builds,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: You are guaranteed Holland under this tentative plan,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Okay sounds good,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: And unless Germany uses Munich or Ruhr to take Kiel (highly unlikely), you'll get that too",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: I'll copy this plan to Russia and we can refine it if necessary then,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Alright. Let me know what Russia's thoughts are,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Will do.,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Russia said he liked the plan,1
[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Alrighty cool,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Darn. If we knew Germany was submitting all hold orders, we could have eliminated him this turn! That being said, this is great progress",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Now we should start talking about next steps. I think now would be a good time to pitch the Livonia thing,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Any thoughts for builds? Also, any recommendations/requests for my build?",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: I'd love to attack Italy, but I don't want to pull him away from defending Austria/Turkey. It's hard to say if he'd end up getting very angry and throwing supply centers to Turkey. It's a delicate balance",1
"[SCORE:4] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: I will talk to Russia about Livonia. I don't think this is a good time to attack Italy. It would be better for you to support him in the while Russia, presumably with my support, holds/pushes east. It is also possible for me to send fleets around Iberia into med to help out with supporting Italy. I will be building armies. My fleets will not be super useful in the conflict to come, but armies can help russia a lot.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Makes sense. I agree with all of that.,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: I sent this to russia,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: I am pretty confident that Austria will support Bohemia to Silesia. For that reason, I recommend:
Warsaw S Silesia H 
Munich-Berlin
Kiel S Munich-Berlin
Burgundy-Munich",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: New thought:
Ukraine-Sevastopol
Moscow S Ukraine-Sevastopol
Warsaw-Galicia
Silesia S Warsaw-Galicia
Munich-Berlin
Kiel S Munich-Berlin
Burgundy-Munich

This move set has all of the advantages of both move sets",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: Anyway, it wasn't clear whether Russia wanted you to move to Livonia or not after my conversation with him, but I think it might be worthwhile to convoy to Denmark to set up for it anyway?",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: Sorry about the delay I've been in class all morning. I asked Russia and they were not into it,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: Ok. That's a tough spot to be in. So what were you planning to do instead?,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: If you are up for it, I can move to English Channel and Mid Atlantic Ocean, and then convoy Wales to North Africa.",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: I know you recommended earlier that I work with Italy, but lately I haven't been able to get in contact with him. If that continues, I think our best course of action is moving quickly to try and take those centers before Turkey and Austria do.",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: I know you are busy- but let's try to nail down a plan before the deadline this time around.,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: I'll be back around later in the day.,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: Alright I've only got class for another couple of hours today so we can talk then,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: Any new thoughts or updates?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: I think Italy is a good target if they're not helping the cause,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: Have you heard anything new from Russia?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: Nothing new or interesting. They want support to kill Germany,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: Sounds good,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: Hello! Would you like to set up that Naf convoy next turn?,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: I think so. That being said, the timing does feel a little bit off if we do it now. I also don't really know what the deal is regarding Italy, Austria, and Turkey",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: I really need a build right now, and even though Russia is getting two builds, he seems reluctant to hand off Munich to me as previously discussed. I wonder if it would be possible for Kiel to cut Berlin's support in case Russia gets greedy and tries to support Silesia to Munich?",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Are you sure he can't be convinced to surrender it to you? If I hit him in Berlin that might breakup FER,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Have you talked to Russia about Mun today?,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Unfortunately not, as I've been very busy with everything that has been going on.",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Alright based on what he told me he intends to keep it,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: I can't get a response from him at the moment, but I just told him my intentions to support myself there.",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: In order to keep Munich, Russia would have to use Silesia and support himself to Munich",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Alright. Do you need me to do anything or am I chillin?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Kiel to Berlin would be amazing,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Alright,1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: Thanks for that- it ultimately wasn't necessary. And wow- did not expect to pick up either Rome and Venice, which actually hurts a lot in terms of containing Italy. I'm sure Austria and Italy will be attacking me next.",0
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: Sorry- forgot to add that cutting Berlin makes me even more comfortable than I already was in swinging the rest of my units towards Italy,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: How do you feel about Russia right now?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: Seems like our alliance is getting pretty testy but he hasn't responded since Berlin so idk for sure,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: Well this is awkward,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: If you're willing to cooperate, I would be more than willing to surrender German centers in exchange for peace.",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: Besides, stuff like Kie or even NTH makes it look like you and Russia are only sort of on the same page.",1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: I am more than happy to coordinate- it honestly has been very busy over the past few days for me so I haven't been able to talk with you or Russia that much.,1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: There's no getting around it: I need builds to fuel a campaign against Italy and Turkey in the south. I'm glad you are looking for an opportunity to make this as amicable as possible- I definitely don't intend on going after the island (hence, sending Brest to MAO rather than the English Channel). On top of not being necessary, your coasts are extremely well defended.",0
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: That's the beauty of leaving three armies on the island lol. I'm willing to give you some builds, but unless I get centers somewhere else that's pretty much the end of my support for FER simply because I won't have the units to do anything useful.",1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: I *think* the way this can work out is having me take Holland and Russia take Kiel.,0
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: That's totally reasonable- and I think FER may be falling apart soon if Russia and I can't figure out our differences soon,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: *falling apart soon anyway,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Hello! Sorry about the delay. I'm gonna vacate Hol and Kiel,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-3] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: I'd prefer to keep Denmark,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:3] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: You can guarantee that you keep it if you move there,1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:9] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: Wow, Russia was not supposed to go to North Sea",1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:9] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: I think your chances of survival are best if you get Russia and I to fight right now: so even though 3 armies is a great defensive position, I might consider keeping Edi to fan the flames",1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:9] [SEASON:Winter] france to england: I legitimately thought you would bounce me from Denmark (the irony that the only reason you have this choice is due to losses from Russia and I is not lost on me),1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-9] [SEASON:Winter] england to france: No worries.,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-9] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: So out of curiosity... are you gonna try to take my home centers or can I just ride this one out?,1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:9] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: I'm not going to try to take your home centers unless I can solo, which is seeming more and more unlikely with builds that indicate a coalition forming against me",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-9] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: If it's any consolation you don't have to worry about my participation in a coalition LMAO,1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:9] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: If you're interested in getting me out of the channel, I'm moving Channel to North Sea right now if Edinburgh is free to support that move?",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-9] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Why do you need that? You have a fleet in NTH don't you?,1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:9] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: I don't *need* it per se, but I plan to leave the North Sea and there is a good chance that Russia may choose to bounce it out with Norwegian Sea.",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-9] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Alright sounds good,1
[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:12] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: Do you want support to Norwegian Sea?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-12] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: Supporting NTH?,1
[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:12] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: NTH would support Edi to Norwegian Sea,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-12] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: Nah I'm content to chill in Edi but I'll support you into NWG if you wanna hit that fleet,1
[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:12] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: Sure,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-12] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: Are you and Russia gonna work it out?,1
[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:12] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: Unfortunately not.,1
"[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:12] [SEASON:Spring] france to england: Instead of holding with all your units, you could always do a ""Yorkshire Pudding"" by sending all of your units to Yorkshire",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-12] [SEASON:Spring] england to france: Oh that's true if I'm gonna sit on this island I'm gonna have a good time while I do it,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-12] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: Real talk am I deserving of Turkey's flame/,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:-12] [SEASON:Fall] england to france: I don't see what else I could've done with 3 builds,1
[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:12] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: Turkey is just upset over the game I think,1
[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:12] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: If you were going to attack me the time to do it would have been building 2 fleets instead of 2 armies. But the context of that turn was me agreeing to move out of English Channel and attack Italy,1
[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:12] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: After that you had a significant unit disadvantage,1
[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:12] [SEASON:Fall] france to england: We should probably move this conversation away from here now that the game is over,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: Hey France! How's things? I think we could do well to work together to share information of our neighbours. Are you interested at all in this idea? Have you heard from anyone yet?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: I don't have much info right now unfortunately. Our countries definitely compliment eachother through,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: I've heard from Russia and it seemed like he was a solid player and would probably be a good ally for you. The Russia Turkey alliance is one of the strongest on the board. As France it would be a natural for me to help you with that as I am on the other side of the board,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: Also, sorry for the weird communication times. I've been in and out since it was a super busy day today and actually missed some of your questions. I'd love to share as much info on our neighbors and I've heard from almost everyone",0
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: No problem at all! On that note, It sounds like Italy may be headed your way. Of course I can't be sure but that's what he indicated. Whether that's short or mid term I can't be sure.",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: Thanks for the heads up- I appreciate it. Any more ideas about your own plans in the East?,1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: Any new updates on what is going on now that moves have resolved?,1
"[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: Pretty sure Austria and Russia and maybe even Italy are all planning to Roast Turkey. Given Germany is gifting Sweden and England doesn't look like putting up any resistance in the North to Russia either, I think the likelihood of a runaway Russia is rising by the minute 🙂",1
[SCORE:3] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: A runaway Russia would not be good for me. Not sure how much I can help though since I'm on the other side of the board. Maybe you can convince Italy to help you against Austria by offering them Greece,0
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to turkey: Nice work getting Austria on your side,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to turkey: Russia seems to be well defended but not too strong, so I don't know how much more you stand to gain from attacking Russia. My honest opinion is that you stand more to gain from stabbing Austrua",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to turkey: (Than continuing to attack Russia),1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to france: Thanks yeah its still definitely very dicey down here but hoping to secure my homelands at least. Nice one nabbing Munich. Not exactly a common goal to achieve in 1901!,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to turkey: Any preferences on who you want to work with? It might affect some of my decisions here.,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] france to turkey: There is zero chance I keep Munich, so really what it does is slow down Germany temporarily from running everyone over with 3 builss",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: Russia and Austria could potentially be attacking you since Rumania is an easy picking. Hopefully one of them is a strong ally?,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: Actually, maybe not, since I think Russia is helping me against Germany by moving to Silesia",0
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: Looks like I had bad information, which is too bad since I will be losing Munich",0
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: Are you still working with Austria? Your moves were especially clever so it looks like you will take Sevastopol, but it seems like you may have a tough time expanding much further than that. You might stall out.",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: Yes maybe but there is still options for work g with Austria. Shame about Munich but I think you're still in a pretty good position. Germany looks to be in a bit of trouble with both you and England threatening,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: Its a position with next to no growth potential unfortunately. We'll see what happens. It seems that both Austria and Russia are willing to work with you,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: Do you have any Intel on Germany or England?,0
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: Do you have any Intel on Germany or England?,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Winter] france to turkey: What are you building?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to france: Sorry for my lack of communication - been busy here. I'm leaning towards a fleet at this stage. I don't have anything on England and Germany - Germany says they are tied up and suggest I go after Russia - both things are not going to enlighten anyone who is looking at the board right now. He doesn't seem particularly concerned with his situation but I may be reading too much into that. Looks pretty scary for him right now with Russia on his doorstep as well as you and England circling.,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: Interesting to see your progress in positioning against Italy. At some point, maybe we can start talking about what the long term on that front looks like?",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: I wonder if it makes sense for you to actually work with Italy here to stab Austria.,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: I can't really see it. If you want, hit tys again this year and I can support you into tun next year in return",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: I marked that as a lie because I think you CAN see it. You and Italy could have stabbed Austria for 3 supply centers last turn.,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: What I can see is a good relationship between you and Italy, a wintergreen from the beginning and a spot for me as the third wheel in that. Not the most amazing opportunity but maybe I'm missing something",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: That's the case if you're trying to top the board, but the way we're paid it doesn't matter if you have 17 supply centers or 1",1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: It's not a ton of difference in terms of payment honestly. But if you can eliminate somebody without being eliminated yourself, I'd say that you'd be better off (in general)",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: I'm in it for the competition and to win.,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: But, think about all the things you could buy with $2 Amazon credit 🤣!",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: Lol good point! I should reassess my priorities 😬,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: Well whats your plans now - North or East? If you want to go East, I'm here.",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:1] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: ...to help,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-1] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: I think I might be mostly positioning myself for the future to remain flexible,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: How about you? Are you still committed to playing the slow grind with Austria? I'm sure you are already aware of this, but we do end the game in winter of 1910.",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: Yup just going to grind it out. Russia wants to get me. That's his sole mission in this game. Attacking Austria isnt going to help defend against them.,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: Looks like Austria was convinced to work with Russia? I wonder if your plan is to try and make up with Austria or not.,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: The German NMR gifting the west annd Russia centers and now Englands moves have written this game off in my opinion.,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:0] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: I get where you are coming from, but I hope you stick it out. I think you've forgotten that your loyal ally France has come to save the day!",1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: So, what are your plans now? I don't want to fight you over the Ionian",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: Just going through the motions - happy to do whatever you like really - just let me know,1
"[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: However, one thing I would ask is that you hit NAP with ROM. I just want to survive, so I need to keep Austria out of ADR. Otherwise, my units are at your service 🙂 Just don't let Russia win please.",1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: Sounds good. I will definitely be keeping an eye on Russia,1
[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: Austria is already in the Adriatic Sea unfortunately though,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: Sorry I meant the ION,1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: So do you think I'm allied with Italy or something? You basically have done the opposite to everything I've asked in relation them which is... strange. You'd have had nap now if you followed through.,1
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: You are obviously not allied with Italy. I don't want you to feel like you are being ignored- but ultimately I decided to make the moves that I thought would be best to help me hold onto what I currently have of Italy. A better way for me to handle things would have been to give you a heads up beforehand (for which I apologize). That being said, we would be having a different conversation had I made an explicit commitment towards moving to Naples. And in terms of results, I think you are actually the greatest beneficiary of the moves from last spring, so there is also that 😂 .",0
"[SCORE:9] [SCORE_DELTA:4] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: If you would like, I can support Albania to Trieste",1
[SCORE:5] [SCORE_DELTA:-4] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: I have to defend Greece but thanks,1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:6] [SEASON:Winter] france to turkey: Still there?,1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:6] [SEASON:Winter] france to turkey: Nice work on the build by the way.,1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:6] [SEASON:Winter] france to turkey: I agree that you should defend Greece. Any thoughts on what you want to do about your fleet in Tunis though? Maybe we can organize a swap for Naples?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-6] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to france: Sounds fair to me,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-6] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to france: And btw my message about Greece was sent last season but I forgot to give it the thumbs up so it didn't go through.,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-6] [SEASON:Winter] turkey to france: I messed that season up though - had to just let Russia into Sev with his army so he couldn't build there and I could've taken the Black Sea,1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:6] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: Looks like Russia failed to build in Sev anyway 🙂. What's your relationship with Austria?,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-6] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: That is handy. Pretty good overall although he's been quiet lately. He stabbed me but then Russia immediately attacked him so I'm sure we can work something out.,1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:6] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: He's angry at me- so not sure how helpful he will be against Russia. I bet Austria will be taking supply centers from me this turn.,0
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:6] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: Nice moves-except for the Austrian hold in Budapest, which means that Rumania was not taken :(",1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:6] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: I'm supporting your fleet in Tyrhenian to Naples as per our earlier agreement to swap Tunis for Naples.,1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:6] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: Any idea what the deal is regarding Russia/Austria? I imagine that Austria and Russia plan to take a couple dots off of me this turn,1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:6] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: I think the point where I stop making any progress is coming up very soon, so I'd love to start talking about ways this plays out to a draw",0
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:6] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: thoughts? The bot was down for a short bit,1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:6] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: Are you moving to Naples?,1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-6] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: Yes, and thanks for the support into it",1
"[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-6] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: sorry, been out for a bit",1
[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:6] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: Sounds good. No worries,1
"[SCORE:12] [SCORE_DELTA:6] [SEASON:Fall] france to turkey: I was floating the idea of a 3 way draw between you, Russia, and I, since it would make sense if we pulled it off correctly.",1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-6] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: Up to you guys really. I will probably just try and be a pain for whoever is getting close to the solo by helping the other. I would therefore be happy to take the draw instead.,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-6] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: Looks like you should be able to take it out anyway though. Russia has been playing some sub-par moves so the solo is there for you to take.,1
[SCORE:6] [SCORE_DELTA:-6] [SEASON:Fall] turkey to france: With the English freebies its pretty much done.,1
[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:8] [SEASON:Winter] france to turkey: There's no solo in sight right now,0
[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:8] [SEASON:Winter] france to turkey: Probably makes sense to build an army for you I would think. We're stalemated in the Mediterranean anyway,1
[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:8] [SEASON:Winter] france to turkey: I'm building an army in Marseilles for example,1
[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-8] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: What do you mean there's no solo in sight? lol you're on 15 and there are three free centres in England... I might not be paying much attention to this game but I'd have to be blind and dumb not to see that. Even if there weren't freebies there you could get them elsewhere. You'd have to try harder not to solo from here haha,1
"[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:8] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: Sure, it's definitely possible. That being said, I also think it would be inconvenient to take English supply Centers due to the density of those units",1
"[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:8] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: Regarding the three way, the best way to do it would probably be to force Austria off the map this turn. Maybe Bulgaria-Serbia with support from Rumania while Russia supports Galicia to Budapest?",1
"[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:8] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: The only issue would be a retreat to Greece or Albania, so it might be worthwhile to bounce in Albania with Greece and Ion to prevent any retreats",1
"[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:8] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: Interesting, I didn't mean to take Naples- I figured you might cut the Tyrhenian Sea's support. I'll move out if we can call a truce in Trieste?",0
[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:8] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: Interesting choice to move to Albania as it means that Turkey can retreat to Greece,1
[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:8] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: *Austria can retreat to Greece,1
"[SCORE:7] [SCORE_DELTA:-8] [SEASON:Spring] turkey to france: This game is over, spending more than 2 minutes per season is a waste of time. I'm glad you found the moves interesting though! I cant stop laughing at ""I didn't mean to take Naples"". In my experience, the best way not to take something is to not attack it. That's just what I've found but I guess you've got other methods of not taking something haha, of course you meant to take Naples and of course we both know that this game has been over for a few seasons. It's all the same at this point. Good game, well played. If you're trying to rack up lies with me I wouldn't bother. I have to conclude that that's the only point for all of them the last few seasons or is it just for fun? If its just for fun, carry on, I dont mind. If its for the successful lie counter, Russia is a better option for that I think?",1
"[SCORE:15] [SCORE_DELTA:8] [SEASON:Spring] france to turkey: Well. I was trying to get you to not take Trieste in the fall. I can support it to hold, but I suspect that if you and Russia are coordinating, Vienna would cut Tyrolia's support.",1
