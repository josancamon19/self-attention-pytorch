Those lips that Love's own hand did make
Breathed forth the sound that said "I hate"
To me that languished for her sake;
So for thee put forth never a sigh
And feel the tone between, thou lovesize'st foe.
I wedded love can sneer not at thee
The very instant he speaks falsehood's name,
Unless there be some pure blood mixing there
Which thee my tongue now doth spend.
Thou mayst that love hath thy right didst repay,
For hast that offense necessitate?
Yes, even love is noblest when bad;
Then what can his falsehood do but shame me?
  Even so with thee he doth plague himself,
  So that, after no offended

Poor soul, the center of my sinful earth,
Pressed with these rebel powers that thee array,
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
When thou art loved by hundreds and thine enemy dear,
Why dost thou wish to stay the hour when thou wilt be scorched?
Why dost thou endure this affliction, being but on earth,
When I will make thy habitation a footstool,
And because I have stayed for thee an hour made,
Thou, by the rebuke of thine angelic mind,
Delights in this entertainment and dost praise thyself.
  But me, mine angel on earth,
  I burn with such tempest that the ashes cold are spied
  Then thanks be

My love is as a fever, longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease,
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
But first starting from that sick, the better,
Expanding an ill his hold on a friend;
Now fever begins to excel, growth extends,
Then fever lies at last -- there dies the madman.
By couch I in profane lore bequeathed
This awful time with rustic proverbs,
For false and false is fever, evil may grow
And improve with words so imparted;
So, too, by sickness my love doth remain,
Or else such public examples do he,
One sad example overturning two,
Which two blushing hastened yet weary by it

O me, what eyes hath love put in my head,
Which have no correspondence with true sight!
Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,
Crowned with cloud that doth blind heaven?
And what am I but a likeness made
To desireable creatures that doth rear
Some pleasure and some hate, proper to compare,
In imperfect hue and plight, and methinks methinks
I take the light back again again,
As into wax whereon thou fond'st my love;
Thus myself and ten times less erst being seen
Assuredly more worthy of true reverence.
  This poor contrariety neither tears nor warms
  My vacancy whereon all impression lies;
  And this constant fading scarcely calms my

Canst thou, O cruel, say I love thee not
When I against myself with thee partake?
Do I not think on thee when I forgot thee,
When my precious soul blamed me when it praised thee?
Be thine in deeds of such difference
As by thy very appearance affright even me,
And I be alone in thine eyes and in thy spite!
We must be for such an instant enemies;
Bury me and our weak soul together,
Depart our voices and our thoughts; we shall be dead,
Death pretending thee better mistress than I.
  But if not for thy deep love, I will love thee
  As thou lovest, deeming all I am sick
  And slavish to all I tell

O, from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway?
To make me give the lie to my true sight,
That never saw, nor could not behold
Those hundredfold regions of heaven and earth
Where filled with not far varlets hundreds of days,
Which bray both sweet and marvellous seeds?
O, the deceivablest spell in the world
That could undo my being, art thou
From all my faculties giveth me motive,
Having to it all that might have been mine.
O, what private esteem art thou to that made
Who in marvellous flower hath print both
The sepulchre and the night in heaven's eye!
  I love of thy sun gold

Love is too young to know what conscience is;
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
Steal not thine inward treasure out of me,
That malice of yours, from where it grows, may do some ill;
For, if thus thy favor oppressed me,
Most manly love overawes the world and lies.
This thy doting tongue seeks not to prove;
It follows thereafter better times and strong requitals.
Therefore love when it can speak redeems thee,
Thy penury delivers your love to out-bearing time.
  So use with thankfulness an ease wailing
  For continual loss which an evil heart brings.

In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;
In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn.
Make this my penance, hear the thanks of men,
Whilst mine easy work in thee doth seem
To hate the sake of loving toward him back.
For fear I enquire, what motives of my nature,
Resembling myself when I laid thee under
Against his resolve, draw him thus aside.
Why do I ask my affection unasked,
Whilst his unsought, and couldst not be known?
Have I haughty presumption left him short memory
Or will he think I such a ribald wit as speak
Where in heart's sweet shade I find nothing

Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep.
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep;
That maid lies in trance as thy beauty looks
In thy lay concealed from him all thy pain.
For this became Dian unkind,
And 'fore he suffered decay
Dulled replete with wine and pepper to thine.
A thief steal, then enticed to prick
To naked puncture doom by death crime,
Which before was swift will before sin.
Yet at length for love of thee he bore,
The manly Venus where he fast grew.
Whilst at my hands his grace within grew
By manner like thy treasured beauty dear,
His means mortal wast to keep

The little love-god, lying once asleep,
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep
Descended on him, sweet love dying sweet,
With choirs of their siren voices their dear one bore.
Then came rushing on sea-chaise,
Kissing and kissing, sylphs he caught up
And set him adrift alone on wind,
Disordered though his purloined wake was,
For his sudden offence holy to holy called.
On 't strand the po'lar wretch squealing fell,
Hanging a-head as the girl came chiding,
Said, "Bear me, dear dead love, not like other."
"What d

When my love swears that she is made of truth,
I do believe her, though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
Made of that trifling demon of trifles,
Whose likeness blots out every ornament of true sense.
But, lo, that thought is false, my love holds.
And for my having the decay stamped on
Her countenance stamps either more honour or disgrace,
Since my love thinks that in her every thing is decreed
That I am the fashion when no other doth bear her word.
  And whether love or no, an assesse looks most disgraceful
  On a worthless jade.


11
Two loves I have, of comfort and despair,
That like two spirits do suggest me still.
My better angel is a man right fair,
And when love grows cold and failing he wanders
To bright marble where he may await his change,
Or drest when fairest pride is painted to decay.
Yet nature's blessing hath this prepossessing jade
Of heart whereon without and within depends,
And methinks loves lack and desire may much thinke,
For she hath an expedient on both accounts:
Within hearts externs are heard much reported,
And if possible shieds his wickedness gett,
For there lives another love than his sweetness doth hate.
  Or, true love's love heard's
