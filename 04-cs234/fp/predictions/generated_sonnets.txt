Those lips that Love's own hand did make
Breathed forth the sound that said "I hate"
To me that languished for her sake;
But mine, foul words express'd,
Made hearts all new seize on me through love,
And hearts don't 'scape what is call'd:
Yet were that which vex'd love freed,
It did pride to lament her present disgrace
Which looks evil but the token true,
Hence receiving that half knowledge
Which shall supply my reason of his words.
  In deeds indeed were he half sweet,
  Yet in speech he exprest himself bitter;
  But surely hearts are not so wise as tongues.

Poor soul, the center of my sinful earth,
Pressed with these rebel powers that thee array,
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
Not knowing where that spring comes from that spring?
Shedding dearth and being stark barren,
Blanketh out from thy glorious shrine urns that are waxed
And produce pure from thine indifferent breast
White as fine marble and hangeth upright,
And in thine urn is ready to be framed,
Like those which been made by barber's instrument.
[To the defects] Back again doth my rest from first blight,
When first it groans, now it is drowsy,
Like asses that despise the sweat of laborers.
  All the straight

My love is as a fever, longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease,
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
When weak wine increases, while more grows;
But beauty, mistress of that firm whose distress
Is to purify art from offence,
Caught along on her bloom is glad to be,
Racing from shadow to shadow in joy,
Lures him upon this to his end.
Hark, yet the full length of it more sees,
Purchasing a treasure within while leaves,
And its odd beauty's mingled shade gives drink,
While its color seems wont to madden.
  As I heave and lift up this beauty,
  I wonder how hence it lies unaven

O me, what eyes hath love put in my head,
Which have no correspondence with true sight!
Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,
Being a spider in love's wing, where my mind is lost?
What part in my love should so countenance,
Unless your 'roidke, being so tightlarded
Whole difference. I love, who see not his figure;
I love, seeing the handle of your rose,
A mode. Then, you know, mine eye finds a reed.
  You do also and see a reed. Your tongue hearst with laughter
  Or shrugging, hiccough, talking of new sweetness,
  In your cabinet you play, your patience wise;
  Then

Canst thou, O cruel, say I love thee not
When I against myself with thee partake?
Do I not think on thee when I forgot
Thy loving thou thou brought me not home
From my lovers' flowers and then so oft
Returned again and again?
O villain, show me if I wonder,
Or see if I should and if I smile.
Be thou from the manners of men thy mother,
Sweet on my birth from chiding father,
Which from love; but thou, who loveth love,
Be not an imp, a strange uncle,
Or the ill-loving daughter of one man.
  Then in spite of of reason all view should be thine.


5
O, from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway?
To make me give the lie to my true sight,
By whose skill is my mind fixed,
Which can never persevere when prey is fled.
'Tis not my worthless eyes, yet if they shone
My impotent person were wholly infatuated;
That I, forsooth, with how much profit might cry
But wanted a shadow of his staid sight,
Gave my life. I bid the liar suffer the truth;
"See me not worth without fire and vain vigor."
What lives of gold thou alone dost hast,
Which to root is envious, to decay still.
  Truly the presence of such weak light

Love is too young to know what conscience is;
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
To cheer this mighty bachelor with your bow
As if your wit had o'errated a blessed boast;
Which who heard your admirers lament your dearth,
If that maiden modesty denied you.
Now write, 'Come, let love take me by thy tender spear,
And to his great horse with thy free form,
Be thou a hope of day in glory great.'
  Yet, then, let him make me deaf,
  For know how to feel him strange, and how
  When thinking thro' him toward his claim,
  Can be no murder, no disturbance of earth.

In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;
In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn
Against thy unchanging faith and all my hope.
The heart still hath me divided to myself,
But the deed itself still hath one part to me,
And still contains itself still in its earthly affection,
The same. Wart thou didst think my root love'sdoubt,
Dismount from this bed to make thy present profit?
If thou be my love it doth hold so justly;
My part'sbend doth my love advise against;
Maim thy cure from again lending thy aid;
How then am I secure when there is no assurance,
  Unheard

Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep.
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep;
And he, whom Dian loved, dwells in its store.
And in his net each flea, eagle, devil,
Lies stuffed with flea's sweet; dew on dew,
Sawn on dew withers lying with death.
Here is the visit of Queen de'er look,
Her golden bridal on this handthrowing palace.
False were not yet the lie but here again
Lies the queen in gilded paper and pens;
She has there, in way of foil bridal presents,
To whom she bestows this praise, even today.

The little love-god, lying once asleep,
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep
Received his divine blessing in change,
Fate's curse held poor beauty's shift in fast
Without direction of obeying hand.
To gain this royal favor: many while he lay
Watched from stealing outward pangs from this day;
The pure blood went sweet, wasted for, he only took,
For "nevermore" is not found for one so sweet.
Twelve months nor week were he dallying away,
Since souls would scarce let him alone.
A mad gaudy stream as it come in loved waste
Has thrashed your white lad's hair black to make it

When my love swears that she is made of truth,
I do believe her, though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
But with all those emporiums and modes,
That prodigies to surpass hym set,
And that I've made my name and my fame an abomination.
She really is of myself, of which more than before I told;
But I find another of myself more true.
Thus proves my unwearied love, that, as thy
Consciousness vouches of thy complexion,
Thus hath she further done since she first glows,
To wed her first true love upon her true tale.
  Thus prove my true love, though ever oft I bare
  Thy daughter when

Two loves I have, of comfort and despair,
That like two spirits do suggest me still.
My better angel is a man right fair,
And of hers I took to thee for company,
When they confounded me first with your care;
My choice is this from thy friend's lover.
Love at whom his charms much please doth rule,
Which doth overcome all others where he dwells,
Moral blandness his blessing merits,
Which gladdens his foe with child-like care.
In the easy state is he who doth best
His form of love to enjoy by haste,
Shining in that degree where praise shines brightest.
  All false delicacy in thy love robs him
  Yet to prove
