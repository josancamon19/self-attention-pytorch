Those lips that Love's own hand did make
Breathed forth the sound that said "I hate"
To me that languished for her sake;
On those lips that whiff'd that did write
The secret of my loneliness;
From those whose nails' glory did frame
The shivering pride that o'ertook me,
One by one they died, one by one,
Like tame ravens that crave their shell.
I know their sighs, and, like them, weep:
But so they that move others' frowns,
Have need to silent love make their moan,
Publicly communicating their woe.
  For those that paint need not suspense,
  Unless other tweet their teardrops with same.

Poor soul, the center of my sinful earth,
Pressed with these rebel powers that thee array,
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
Pointing thine eyes even to hell, there to suffer burn?
No fear on my part, sweet soul, my reason determines;
From whence do these beams issue but from thy brain,
Exceeded with the cloud that nightly doth blot out
The fixed stars and comets that so grace the heaven?
To thee mine eye answers no question;
Though to the rest of the universe I lend an tongue,
I alone of the angry brood can make none understand.
  To thee I send these rude merits of woe,
  To show false philosophers how far sweet experience leads.


2
My love is as a fever, longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease,
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
Even till that which by his preservation was smitten.
The keen madman's stigmata feed upon the living eye,
Drinking away the living light;
But, true believers, love lives ere that is seen,
  And hence there is no likelihood of it being kind.


3
O me, what eyes hath love put in my head,
Which have no correspondence with true sight!
Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,
That I through infinity should learn to follow,
After that star that leads my eternal way?
No; I am rightly led, though on the wing
Of some charybdis, whose even shows strange turn.
And so are you, although a god in love
Delights in false points and numbers doubting;
Finding no pattern to your frame set,
And forced to follow a style mixed poor.
  Now taste the beauteous stampede of happiness,
  Or languid estrangement of that which doth spin.


4
Canst thou, O cruel, say I love thee not
When I against myself with thee partake?
Do I not think on thee when I forgot to breathe,
When fate had brought us so short a day?
Do I not tell the time when thou art to depart,
When I am too proud to chide myself if now I fly?
Thou dost merit the applause of thy days,
But still mine own praise is not thine;
Even to thy dearest meekness I desist,
Paying no regard to the blind enmity
Which thinks me niggard and doth mangle my name.
  If I depart with thee, it must be by night;
  Or sick levity in my breeding keeps


5
O, from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway?
To make me give the lie to my true sight,
Or think myself inferior to thy deeds,
Thy gains exaggerated are not greater than mine,
And therefore to be in love is easiest.
O, benefit of ill deeds! How abundant
The harmful seeds which in themselves are hid.
When another confounds mine alteration,
My bounty impels me on to him;
And, being on his side, I gain an illsay,
And by imaginary barbs make myself a subject.
  But if he prove his slander; then of methinks
  Mine ugly bottom shall forbay my pride.

Love is too young to know what conscience is;
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
Since in the strict observance of thine
Thy own sweetness doth ultimately corrupt.
Look what sweet licensing gives to libertin's knife--
A soft gate to churls and villains,
Which if all moors were shaken would prove
One ill guardian to his cattle.
For, true enough, love is a loathsome weed,
Hard of growth, prone to quarrel,
Resembling strong fish that, being once thrust in the hand,
Spread themselves so that the wrack reaches far.
  If a goddess loved my darling,
  She would stain her love with my


7
In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;
In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn,
Both in word and in action untrue;
So dost mine affections do swear by thee,
And for my sake too unwillingly break
My vows to my true love; so that my hate
Crawls like an impotent mob
Before the thousands that help thee in thee,
And like an attorney stands in the field
To prove my innocence or defense.
  But methinks in my bitter love there is
  A wisdom unseen, which enfolds all within,
  That sullies not the foe but makes him love thee more.

Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep.
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep.
One of his three nurses she obtained,
Who, lewd in love, lodged in his breast,
And loving him as her master's nurse doth,
Without touching his burn.
The second gave breath to crow like him,
And third, false love, confused his cry;
But when his death them told did seem,
The maid that kept his light the wretch saw
Had put his corpse in her soft hand;
The corpse being deemed safe, she slept.
  Then came the third nurse, roused from her dream,
  And hunted after the false comrade,
  Finding


9
The little love-god, lying once asleep,
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep
Within his amorous grasp interrupted his slumbers,
Distributing holy water on his face;
Until at length the bloody ruin
Of that most devoted wight his sweet fear had broke,
And, out of mutual hate cremated,
Made his sweet flower out of his brain.
  Their memory to this day hath that sanction
  Which vile sacrilege cannot quench;
  And, to this very day, virtuous women weep
  To this day for the love that perpetrated it.


10
When my love swears that she is made of truth,
I do believe her, though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
Created for the golden days when truth set foot.
But since she swears so, let me not be deceived
As by half-swearing fools; her simple love
Aims toward perfection, and to keep
The truth stands in jeopardy of elation.
Yet assuredly she's of one thing, true,
And that is love, and none else save in it.
  She refuses to be stained with baseness,
  Which makes others so vile; so I'll not be assailed
  With false prejudging of time, to praise nothing.

Two loves I have, of comfort and despair,
That like two spirits do suggest me still.
My better angel is a man right fair,
With eyes like fire, a soul as wide awake,
Who spreads his wings in the morning's bright
And takes all things in his abundance.
My earthly companion is sadder still,
Great swain, rudderless, with black mouthed brow,
That, fond of travel, scythe that none can knife,
Plods vauntly in the lead of winter;
A sole preserve, in his swiftness steered
By strong spirits that must both bear and steer
In wars of all for the lead of one.
  But I love this better angel so,
  That,
