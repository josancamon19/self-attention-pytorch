Those lips that Love's own hand did make
Breathed forth the sound that said "I hate"
To me that languished for her sake;
And yet those same lips could not speak
To those loving eyes, who with mine were fixed.
Of those lips that did kiss mine, yet had I less
Than that sweet opium which that tender jade
Stirred up in their white futures,
As the whistle of the cicada in summer's wood
Echoes golden sounds that it hears on the sea.
  Then, like the curthoise on the water's edge
  Sitting on the green moss, I gazed on those gray
  Of those lips that did kiss mine, and saw not the change.

Poor soul, the center of my sinful earth,
Pressed with these rebel powers that thee array,
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
Being sweet to tenderness but full of rage?
O, be of better mind, and off with this need,
As if thou wert delirious with thy sins;
Rise, and be guided by thyself; I dare not
Stand to keep thy hand when thou hast broken faith.
For if thou shalt not depart, to-morrow
Thou hast no such great disturbance committed,
For as the knife is laid in a feast,
So is the malady in the breast of thee
Considered as but a sweet and useful gore.
  Thus thou contrary dost bruise that

My love is as a fever, longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease,
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
Consumed with the would of the rarest sight.
For it is certain that time wastes away
And breeds no change but tyrants,
And every blessed instant subscribes
The law of an instant with this sick faith:
"Now I have been within this moment
Since first I was breathed in this world,
And, loving and thinking nothing of the future,
This moment was my first love, and all past
Since has been but his second moment in time."
  So loves will endure even to eternity,
  though their objects sad and forlorn

O me, what eyes hath love put in my head,
Which have no correspondence with true sight!
Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,
Looking to others, to my judgment no house?
No eye hath cognizance of my substance,
Of other's being, of surety or doubt,
Of how many spouses I have, or of what son
They shall have this day or that. To know these things is the purpose
Of all those masters which eyes have made;
To take interest in them every day of life,
Like monkeys in a mat time of fight, nimble
To feast, but full hungry; those windows great teacies
Of joy and contented niggarding kept from me,
Dulled with constant r

Canst thou, O cruel, say I love thee not
When I against myself with thee partake?
Do I not think on thee when I forgot thee?
Thy inconstant hand now my beauty's fastening;
In hours and in days when I feel no pleasure
Canst thou, being fond, willst my golden back deny?
Then, love, do not in my desire hold back
The Persian quicksilver that drinks into my breast;
Ten thousands thanks for a thousand doth it cost
To take him from thy bosom, ten thousands that take.
In such haste do I drink it, and give away
My very life for his to prevent;
In so doing double thine in me assuredly lie,
  Since having

O, from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway?
To make me give the lie to my true sight,
To make my utmost prize what difficulty
My best nature must need to remove
From argument's hold. Be what hath been thy desire
By striving to be more than thou art,
Give me thy bless'd blessing, and I'll be a slave
To thy pleasure, poor though it be;
Take thou my greatest grief, my most deepest woe,
And I will bear it willingly, because
Thy will is true and pure mind under duty.
  If my conceit offend thee, know it is cowardice;
  I shall be as cunning in converse
  As most the wis

Love is too young to know what conscience is;
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
For thus thy love doth call me back again.
Aye, call I thee back, but not with ill will;
Do not thwart my composition
With untrue tale of ill minded hurt;
Give me the fair aspect that I desire,
And bear with faults whatsoever thou dost find.
So I discharge thy love, and in thy dear pen
I find all thy good eloquence writ;
Nor do I turn out bad when thou dost approve
  And breed confidence in all thy words.


7
In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing;
In act thy bed-vow broke, and new faith torn.
So let not this slight trespass lead
To break another oath, this thy faithful love's break,
If I in loving thee swear thy love back again.
If in willing thee this let my law forbid,
Then give back thy pure wish if my command forbid.
Thou in loving me must suspect me of ruination,
To confound thine in giving back love;
So suspect I, and I give back thy heart too;
  There can be no more prove in love than here said.

Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep.
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep;
She asked what was the cause, and he saith
"Thy grace is best bestowed on women,
And lovers bestow it on their sweet-ones
When circumstances permit."
And to this she denied no answer
But gave an example in love's matter
Which stung him not at all: "O Venus," say they,
"what crime wouldst thou commit
By loving more than thy trueportion grants!
If thy sun were changed for death,
What wealth wouldst thou inherit of our world?
But if thy blessed hue were buried alive,
What riches wouldst thou have

The little love-god, lying once asleep,
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep
The silent swain's sweet word devoutly worshiped.
Still came this jealous monster on to night,
And took from his glowing couch the slain love,
Which cherubin stole from tender Stephen's hand;
That tender book soon fell to silvered bones,
And the choirmaster's widow feared lest it show
That beauty's blood still lives in this;
But thence it came to be told, and thus it was:
The dead love was rich in all respects wealth,
Save that his brow was weary of love's fare;
Thus was his quality expressed: "'Tis said,"


10
When my love swears that she is made of truth,
I do believe her, though I know she lies,
That she might think me some untutored youth,
Whilst she her skill in form was learned.
For truth is but a title given
To churls and dumblings, whom our kings prove
To counterfeit princes; and no wonder,
For falsehood in this craft doth all live.
O, what a crown of glory doth beauty bear
When her basest shadow with truth hath stamped it,
And every witty line a loyal root?
  O, be grateful! Such breasts do need a moaning;
  That kicks with a sigh should make a thousand loves.


11
Two loves I have, of comfort and despair,
That like two spirits do suggest me still.
My better angel is a man right fair,
Hung with many triumphs, rich in treasure buried;
But his pride stands in slander and in scorn,
And my more sweet love is in poverty confined,
Stirred to and fro by his black jester.
Sweet love, put a chastity in your thoughts,
That you may yourself be well thought of too,
For false empty speech often grows quite true.
  The ear that lulls with sweet voices soon tires,
  And true songs seldom if at all heard begin.
