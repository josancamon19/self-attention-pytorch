# Transformers From Scratch

- Started with: https://www.kaggle.com/code/auxeno/transformers-from-scratch-dl
- Then just went on finding loopholes in understanding and asking llm's to judge my knowledge + explaining them.
- Also went through https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/ here, specially to understand better pos encoding, but didn't learn anything new.
- "Hands on LLM OReilly" - has ton's of great content, no great explanation on meanings positional encoding.
- Most basics were cover in the first Kaggle notebook, amazing resource
  - Had issues with Training, didn't work, lol, required an easy fix.
